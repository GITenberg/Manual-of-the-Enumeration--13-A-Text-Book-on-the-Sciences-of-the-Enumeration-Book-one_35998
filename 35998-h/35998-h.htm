<p class="figcenter"><b>Arrangement</b></p>

<p><a name="anch_p0vi_1" id="anch_p0vi_1"> </a>
This book I is intended as a progressive textbook, by
which anyone who is totally unfamiliar with the Enumeration
may, in a practical way, learn its sciences sufficiently
to grasp the many beautiful laws of the Enumeration
and apply them.</p>

<p>
This will help to rebuild your life and give you almost
a new world in which to live.</p>

<p>
To assist you in gaining this knowledge more easily,
this work has been arranged in three major volumes,
called Book I, Book II and Book III.</p>

<p>
Book I, is designed to introduce you to the subject
matter in the Enumeration, in its more simple forms
and in its applications.</p>

<p>Book II, is designed to enable you to analyze others
and to help them, thereby increasing your own knowledge
and ability to order your life, for "he who teaches
is doubly taught."</p>

<p>
Book III, enables you, as a teacher or minister of
the Enumeration, to know and apply some of the
deeper phases of group psychology, and to answer
some of the questions of the more educated minds, as
to "the hope that is in you."</p>

<p>
In the front of this Book I will be found a list of the
General Contents of Book I. At the back of this Book
will be found a very complete Topical index of Book
I, by which special lessons may be made up and by
which you may make very ready reference to the teachings
of the Enumeration on any subject. These indexes,
we feel, need no explanation to the average person
sufficiently progressive to have come thus far in
the study of the Enumeration.</p>

<p>
<b>a, b, c, d, etc.,</b> refers to the paragraphs so marked
throughout this text book and these letters are used to
aid you when referring to the Index. They are for
reference use only, and do not refer to the subject matter
of the paragraphs.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>

Alphabetical Table of Enumeration, on our left,
<span style="float:left;"><img src="images/009-1.jpg" style="width:50px; height:300px;" title="" alt="Chart of the Lumanus" /></span>
we find the value of each
letter. Thus A is the first letter
of the alphabet, and has the
value of 1. J is the tenth letter.
1 and 0 is 1. Therefore the
value of J is 1. S is the nineteenth
letter. 1 and 9 is 10. 1
and 0 is 1. Thus the value of S
is 1. In like manner the value
of each letter will prove to be that of the
figure which stands beside it in this table.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p001_b" id="anch_p001_b">b</a>&mdash;</b> The second or Numerological
Table of the Enumeration No. 2 on page
VIII shows the value of all the letters in the
English alphabet, coupled with the word
expressing the inner meaning of each letter.
Enumerators in other tongues are
invited to make and interpret their own
Tables on Enumeration according to their
language.</p>

<p>Either the Alphabetical or the Numerological
Table of Enumeration are used
to find the values of the letters in working
out the Personality Number of a
Name, or the value of a word, in the English
Tongue. The meanings of the various
numbers and letters are explained as we go further
into the Manual of the Enumeration.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p001_c" id="anch_p001_c">c</a>&mdash;</b> The third or Astrological Table of the Enumeration
marked No. 3 explains the values and places of
the planets and the signs of the Zodiac, according to
the nine figures, or Numerology. This Astrological
Table of Enumeration is used to show the place of the
life and occupation of any person, for comparison with
the other facts found in an analysis of the person thru
the Enumeration.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p class="konubas">NUMEROLOGY</p>

<p><b>Definition 1.</b> The Enumeration is the collection of
sciences of human analysis by which we analyze the
purposes and direction of the life of the Soul on this
earth plane.</p>

<p><b>Definition 2.</b> The principal sciences of the Enumeration
are Numerology, Astrology, Graphology,
Psychology and Cosmology.</p>

<p><b>Definition 3.</b> Numerology gives an indication of
about twenty-five per cent of the influences in life; Astrology
indicates about fifteen per cent of those influences;
Graphology indicates about fifteen per cent.
The rest of the influences of life may then be calculated
by the study of Psychology, Cosmology, heredity, environment,
education, etc.</p>

<p><b>Definition 4.</b> In the study of Numerology we find
there are seven principal numbers that indicate what
influences prevail in your life. In the order of their importance
to you these are: THE SOUL PATH NUMBER,
THE PERSONALITY NUMBER, THE THREE
PREDOMINANT NAME NUMBERS, THE DESTINY
NUMBER, and the PUBLIC APPEARANCE NUMBER.</p>

<p class="konubas">SOUL PATH NUMBER</p>

<p><b>Definition 5.</b> We find the SOUL PATH NUMBER
by adding together all the figures found in a birthdate.
For example: The birthdate August 15th, 1906, would
first be written 8 15 1906. Then we would add all
these figures together, 8 and 1 and 5 and 1 and 9 and 0
and 6, which would make a total of 30. Then we add
the 3 and 0, making 3. Three is therefore the SOUL
PATH NUMBER of the birthdate, August 15, 1906.</p>

<p><b>Definition 6.</b> The SOUL PATH NUMBER shows
us what we came to this earth plane to do.</p>

<a name="anch_p004_1" id="anch_p004_1"> </a></p>

<p><b>Definition 7.</b> We find the PERSONALITY NUMBER
by adding together the values of all the letters
found in a name as naturally written. For example:

<p>Adding the values of these letters together we get

used, including the MRS. The adding of these figures

of MRS. R. J. WILCOX.</p>

together gives us a total of 44. 4 and 4 make 8. 8 is
therefore the PERSONALITY NUMBER of Mrs. Ella
Wilcox.</p>

shows us how we are best adapted to do what we came
here to do.</p>

<p class="konubas">THREE PREDOMINANT NAME NUMBERS</p>

<p><b>Definition 9.</b> We find the THREE PREDOMINANT

their sum, as naturally written. For example: The name</p>

<p>
We find the highest number that is repeated is 9
(marked +). The second highest number that is repeated
is 6 (marked @); while the third highest number
that is repeated is 3 (marked "). 9, 6 and 3, in
their order, are therefore the THREE PREDOMINANT
NAME NUMBERS of the name R. J. WILCOX.<br /><br /></p>

30. 3 and 0 make 3. Taking the highest number repented,
we get 6. The second highest number repeated
is 3. There is no third number, so we must repeat the
6, as being the highest number. Thus 6, 6 and 3 are
the THREE PREDOMINANT NAME NUMBERS in
the name F. O. FOX.</p>

<p><b>Definition 11.</b> The THREE PREDOMINANT
NAME NUMBERS show us what we will attract to ourselves
while we are doing what we came here to do.</p>

<p class="konubas">DESTINY NUMBER</p>

<p><b>Definition 12.</b> We find the DESTINY NUMBER
by adding together the SOUL PATH NUMBER, THE
PERSONALITY NUMBER, THE THREE PREDOMINANT
NAME NUMBERS. For example: R. J. WILCOX,
born August 15th, 1906, find the DESTINY NUMBER.
We found the SOUL PATH NUMBER to be 3,
the PERSONALITY NUMBER to be 6 and the THREE
PREDOMINANT NAME NUMBERS to be 9, 6 and 3.
Now adding all these, 3 and 6 and 9 and 6 and 3 we
get the sum 27. 2 and 7 are 9. 9 is therefore the
DESTINY NUMBER of R. J. WILCOX born August
15th, 1906.</p>

<p><b>Definition 13.</b> The DESTINY NUMBER shows us
what the great objective of the Soul was in coming to
this incarnation.</p>


<p class="konubas">THE PUBLIC APPEARANCE NUMBER</p>

<p><b>Definition 14.</b> We find the PUBLIC APPEARANCE
NUMBER by adding the values of all the initials
together, in a name as naturally written. For example:
R. J. WILCOX, we take the values of the initials only,
9 1 5. Adding these we get a total of 15. 1 and 5
make 6. 6 is therefore the PUBLIC APPEARANCE
NUMBER of R. J. WILCOX.</p>

<p>we would take
the initials of the MRS., also; (see page 2) 4 9 1 5,
making 19. 1 and 9 make 10. 1 and 0 make 1. 1 is
therefore the PUBLIC APPEARANCE NUMBER of
MRS. R. J. WILCOX.</p>

<p>But if Mrs. Wilcox should sign her name MRS.
ELLA WILCOX, then we would use her initials as they
appeared in her name, 5 and 5 which would make 10.
1 and 0 make 1, the same as before in this case. 1 is
therefore the PUBLIC APPEARANCE NUMBER of
MRS. ELLA WILCOX.</p>

<p class="konubas">ASTROLOGY</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><b>Principal Influences</b></p>

<p><b>Definition 16.</b> In Astrology there are four principal
influences affecting your life. Remember that these
are INFLUENCES not fates.</p>

<p>In the order of their importance these influences
are, THE SUN SIGN, shown by the date of your birth;
the PRINCIPAL PLANET, called the Ruling Planet of
the SUN SIGN; your PRESENT HOUSE, determined
by the number of your present year, based on your age
next birthday; and the PLANETARY ASPECTS, determined
by the relationships of all the Planets to each
other. For all practical purposes a Raphael's
Ephemeris for the given year of your birth, will show
you with sufficient accuracy, your SUN SIGN, your
PRINCIPAL PLANET and its position, and the major
PLANETARY ASPECTS.</p>

<p><b>Definition 17.</b> The SUN SIGN shows us what lines
of occupation we may follow to advantage; what our
chief characteristics are likely to be; with what other
SUN SIGN we could best mate or become partners and
what major likes and dislikes we may have.</p>

<p class="konubas">PRINCIPAL PLANET</p>

<p><b>Definition 18.</b> The PRINCIPAL PLANET adds to
a knowledge of our characteristics and shows more
fully the nature of our mind and its reactions.</p>

<p><b>Definition 19.</b> The PRINCIPAL PLANET may
sometimes be offset in its influence by another planet
having a better set of aspects or in a more influential
position in our horoscope.</p>

<p class="konubas">POSITIONS OF THE NUMBER 1</p>

<p>The effects of the five principal positions of the
number 1 in life are as follows:</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p014_g" id="anch_p014_g">g</a>&mdash;1 as a Soul Path Number</b> (see page 3)
shows that this Soul Path will bring out a distinct and
rather self-centered life, especially adapted to be the
head of a large business, good executive, somewhat
musical and artistic. You are a strong fighter for your
rights, resent interference, look out for number one
at all times, but are honest and frank in that seeking.
You should choose a path of original or creative effort
of a public type.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p014_h" id="anch_p014_h">h</a>&mdash;1 as a Personality Number</b> (see page 4)
will tend to make you a natural leader and cause others
to seek to put responsibility on you. Do not shirk these
responsibilities. You should show executive and inventive
ability and, while not thrusting yourself forward,
always be READY TO TAKE THE LEAD. It is
for you. People will soon learn to lean on your opinion,
if you express your ideas only after due thought in your
own way.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p014_j" id="anch_p014_j">j</a>&mdash;1 as a Predominant Name Number</b> (see page
4) would tend to attract around you people who
are also leaders but in a lesser degree. You must ALWAYS
find something for these people to do, for the
prompt taking charge of them in the line you are handling
and setting them to work, convinces them that
their coming to you was justified, that you <b>are</b> an authority.
If a leader really greater than yourself is attracted
to you through your number 1 effect, you will
know it, and must then ABSORB all you can as fast
as possible, going onward to your own form of leadership.
With 1 predominant, you should really set up
your OWN institution or establishment, however
humble to start with.<br /><br /></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="sidenote">FIRST PRINCIPLE OF CREATION</span><br /><br /></p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p015_k" id="anch_p015_k">k</a>&mdash;1 as a Destiny Number</b> (see page 5) shows
a definite form of public success in following out the
career, and nearly always tends to bring you out before
the public in an exhibitive way, such as a public
speaker, singer, lecturer, teacher, etc.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p015_l" id="anch_p015_l">l</a>&mdash;1 as a Public Appearance Number</b> (see page
5) this shows that you will best come before your
people as the leader or chief of your talent. No matter
what the obstruction seems to be, you should keep
striving till you do arrive that way. You are fitted to
be just that and should accept nothing less. This may
not be so much as a public speaker, but more as the directing
head, such as the leader of an orchestra or the
manager of a theatrical troupe.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p015_m" id="anch_p015_m">m</a>&mdash;Warning&mdash;</b>The easiest fault of the number
1 in any of the above places is to enlarge conceit, develop
egotism, and generally make you much too
selfish. Be especially careful to see that all your acts
are a real benefit to the other person. You, especially,
in such case, need to "love thy neighbor as thyself."
(Matt. 22:39; James 2:8.) But remember also that
you should be compensated for the good you do in order
to really help others.</p>


<p class="konubas">THE FIRST PRINCIPLE OF CREATION</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p015_mm" id="anch_p015_mm">mm</a>&mdash;</b>Everything in creation exists by reason of the
Seven Principles of Creation. All men or women who
become successful must use these Seven Principles in
their order. The use of them can be readily traced in
the life and works of any great or successful man or
woman.</p>

<p>The First Principle of Creation is FORCE.</p>

<p>FORCE, when rightly exerted, always leads to
POWER.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p015_n" id="anch_p015_n">n</a>&mdash;</b>FORCE always produces your POWER, in
health, mind, money or your perception of Soul and its
curve, in accordance with the way you apply the
FORCE.</p>

<p>In the First Chapter of Genesis we are told that on
the First Day God CREATED, used FORCE. Creation
has required FORCE ever since, both in the conception
of the idea, which forced us out of former habits to the
new thing, and in bringing forth the idea at the birth,
as it were.</p>

both physical and moral. You have much self-confidence,

to be aware of being too rash and headstrong, for you
are rather inclined to be aggressive and self-willed;
and you are likely to bring many troubles upon yourself
through this. You have a good deal of pride, which
is easily wounded, and you do not find it easy to remain
cool and self-restrained under provocation. You are
an active and energetic worker and can accomplish

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p018_u" id="anch_p018_u">u</a>&mdash;</b>Aries <img alt="aries" src="images/aries.gif" /> is the first sign of the Zodiac, the
first Sub-Luma on the Chart of the Lumanus, a
fiery, cardinal and leading sign. You want to see the
world and all that lies therein. No description or
travelogues will satisfy you. You are faithful, just and
kind; an originator to some extent; a good and practical
architect; if you finally take up that work. Your
buildings would not tumble down, and they would
demonstrate the finer features of art. You are interested
in psychics, magic--all curious and hidden lore.
At the same time these pursuits do not interfere with
your daily life. In fact, your friends may not even be
aware that these subjects have an interest for you. In
temperament, you are inclined to materialism and are
not religious in any orthodox way. You are strongly
intuitive, impressionable, rather emotional. Learn to
become even in your temper, and be careful how you
bestow your love.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p018_v" id="anch_p018_v">v</a>&mdash;</b>You are a good planner, and generally forsee
the results of any action, but you are not quite competent
to carry out your own ideas alone. You are more
or less enthusiastic, impulsive, headstrong, self-willed
and likely to go to extremes. So when the individual
character is much stronger than the personal, it inclines
toward righteous indignation, hasty speech and lack of
discretion when thrown into contact with others. You
possess a great amount of force and energy and a full,
rich and generous nature; plenty of vitality and enthusiasm,
and also much hope and activity. You are
never lacking in spirit and have plenty of vim and confidence
in yourself and will never be short of what the
world calls pluck. You are, at times, somewhat inclined
to assert yourself needlessly, so that you must
avoid giving way to impulses, and doing things rashly
or jumping at conclusions so quickly.<br /><br /></p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p019_w" id="anch_p019_w">w</a>&mdash;</b>In order to safeguard yourself against disappointments,
failures or sadness, you should be in a quiet
frame of mind, in settling important affairs, as it would
be more to your advantage to think it over before acting,
instead of being too hasty. As love is the only influence
which can gain control over people of this sign,
love should guide the hand and mind. Your troubles
are so generally the result of disturbed mental conditions,
due to worry, anger, jealously, impatience, etc.,
that the way to avoid them is very clear. Calmness,
self-analysis and complete subjugation of the passions,
will enable you to become healthy, influential and successful
in all you undertake.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p019_x" id="anch_p019_x">x</a>&mdash;</b>The Sub-Lumas, being a part of the same
window of Life as the Lumas, they also have a numeral
relationship to the Lumas above them. Thus, Aries <img alt="aries" src="images/aries.gif" />,
the first Sub-Luma, is under the influence of the 1
space, the God Luma, and is really an earthly reflection
of the Almighty Judge Supreme, in that Aries <img alt="aries" src="images/aries.gif" /> people
are excellent judges of people and events although at
times hasty in their conclusions. They sometimes fail to
remember that APPEARANCES may be deceptive.

These influences are general and in
your First House you may look for changes
affecting these portions of life. The God-Spirit
will focus most noticeably in Mars <img alt="mars" src="images/mars.gif" />

concerned, so you may use energy, force and combative
qualities in changing to advantage during these years;

<b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p023_a" id="anch_p023_a">a</a>&mdash;</b>Title, CREATIVE CHRIST CONSCIOUSNESS.
These words have a value
of 119. 1 and 1 and 9 make 11. The 1 and
1 of the 11 make 2, symbolizing the Second
Person of the Godhead.</p>

<p><span style="float:left;">

<b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p023_b" id="anch_p023_b">b</a>&mdash;</b>The Creative Christ Consciousness
(space 2 of the Chart of the Lumanus)
represents the Soul in the high vibration. Soul and Lord
mean the same in the Bible; and the Bible is much
more easily understood if soul is known to mean the
Lord. Each individual being on earth,
man or beast, bird or serpent, vegetable
or mineral, is expressing a part of that
Soul or Lord. Man is the Christ Consciousness
expressing intelligence. All the
rest beneath man are vibrational imitations
or images of that expression. Having
the Creative Christ Consciousness,
whether consciously or unconsciously expressed,
man is thus a god, in accordance
with the scriptures, and the confirmation
of the Christ Consciousness. (Psalms
82:6. John 10:33, 34.) The words Creative
Christ Consciousness total to the
number 2.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p023_c" id="anch_p023_c">c</a>&mdash;</b>The color for the Son Luma or 2
space, is Gold. The Son Luma represents
the Soul before its entrance into this incarnation
in an earthly temple or body.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p023_d" id="anch_p023_d">d</a>&mdash;</b>The letters under the 2 are, B,
K and T, meaning BEARER of the
KING'S TITHES. It symbolizes the Soul
which inspires you to Tithe or give the
Tenth to spiritual things. It brings the
secret blessing.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><b>Personally</b></p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p023_e" id="anch_p023_e">e</a>&mdash;</b>A conspicuous 2 in your name or
birthdate (see page 13, paragraph e)
tends to make you tactful, diplomatic, shrewd, and a
power back of someone more dominant at times. Makes
you somewhat feminine, kindly and gentle. Faults to
be careful of: deceit, shallowness, a "me-too" servility
and timidity.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p024_f" id="anch_p024_f">f</a>&mdash;</b>The planet of the 2 is the Moon [Symbol: Lune], decreasing.
The sign of the 2 is Taurus <img alt="taurus" src="images/taurus.gif" /> and Aquarius <img alt="aquarius" src="images/aquarius.gif" /> the 11th
sign. 1 and 1 make 2. If your name has in it a B, it
increases your Soul qualities in the 2; if a K, it increases
your Mind qualities; if a T, it increases your Body qualities,
particularly as applied to your Spiritual understanding
in all three cases.</p>


<p class="konubas">POSITIONS OF THE NUMBER 2</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p024_g" id="anch_p024_g">g</a>&mdash;2 as a Soul Path Number</b> (see page 3) shows
that you chose a pathway where the qualities of diplomacy,
tactfulness, and arbitration could be used. Your
soul is seeking especially the use of the affections and
emotions and their effects in life. You will naturally
choose peaceful and quiet paths and about the only
time you would fight is in defense of a friend, a loved
one or a helpless person. In your own differences with
others you will seek a path of peaceful, even though
wordy, settlement.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p024_h" id="anch_p024_h">h</a>&mdash;2 as a Personality Number</b> (see page 4) tends
to make you a sort of "power behind the throne," seeking
the position of consultation, trust and counsellor to
some more dynamic personality. Your personality
readily makes friends and thus makes you a fine
"mixer" for some types of genius who need friends but
find it hard to make or hold them. You can therefore
best manifest in this life as a secretary, diplomat, accountant,
lawyer, adjuster of claims, etc. You will
also find a natural channel along the lines of social
service work.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p024_j" id="anch_p024_j">j</a>&mdash;2 as a Predominant Name Number</b> (see
page 4) tends to attract to you those who are diplomatic,
suave and even the cunning types, for which
you must be careful and not be deceived by flattery.
You will also naturally attract to yourself those
who would use your diplomatic ability and then not
admit that you had anything to do with the victory
obtained. Be careful to see your own interests as well
as the other person's in what you do and make them
admit to start with that they DO need your help and
will pay you for it in whatever manner you may now
deem best. Otherwise you will get soured on the "ungrateful
world" and spoil your life as well as others.<br /><br /></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="sidenote">THE NUMBER 2</span><br /><br /></p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p025_k" id="anch_p025_k">k</a>&mdash;2 as a Destiny Number</b> (see page 5) shows
possibilities in the lines of diplomacy, law and soliciting.
It shows that your destiny is best worked out
when working with others, although you may, through
diplomatic and shrewd understanding, be up close to
the head of a large business or very successful enterprises.
Still, you would always have a definite head to
look to for final orders. Part of your destiny can well
be worked out in social reform work of some type.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p025_kk" id="anch_p025_kk">kk</a>&mdash;2 as a Public Appearance Number.</b> As a
Public Appearance Number, the 2 symbolizes the
lawyer, the diplomat, the planner and giver of ideas.
It shows that you can best appear before your public
in a concealed manner, as the power BEHIND the apparent
head of things. With this 2 you should strive
to make your greatest mark as the director of the mind
that will appear before the public. Keep your ambitions
within those bounds.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p025_l" id="anch_p025_l">l</a>&mdash;Warning to Number 2.</b> FAULTS: Very easy
for the 2 person to get disgruntled or peeved, to allow
ambition to carry on beyond the right depths and to
strive for that which will be practically so unattainable
as to embitter, even if attained. Use diplomacy on self
and show yourself what a good life this is after all,
everything considered.</p>

<p class="konubas">THE SECOND PRINCIPLE OF CREATION</p>

<p>The SECOND Principle of Creation is CHOICE.</p>

<p>CHOICE, properly exerted, always leads to
RICHES. CHOICE always affects your Riches, in
health, mind, money or soul-perception, according to
the way and manner in which you exert the CHOICE.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p025_m" id="anch_p025_m">m</a>&mdash;</b>In the first Chapter of Genesis we are told
that on the Second Day God DIVIDED, or made a
choice between, the waters (Truth) which were
UNDER the firmament, the Physical Truth; and the
waters (Truth) which were above the firmament, the
Spiritual Truth.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p025_n" id="anch_p025_n">n</a>&mdash;</b>In this life the Enumerator learns to choose
which is the Spiritual Truth, which is the Psychic
Truth, which is the Monetary Truth, which is the Mind
Truth and which the Animal Truth. Then the Enumerator
APPLIES each Truth in the plane where it belongs.</p>
<!-- Page 25} -->
<!-- {Page 26 -->
<p><a name="anch_p026_1" id="anch_p026_1"> </a></p>
<p>Thus we know and USE the Truth on each plane,
without belittling any. By this means we do not need
to convert the Body or Animal nature. We merely
keep it in its place and make it serve there, WHEN
and HOW we will.</p>

<b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p026_nn" id="anch_p026_nn">nn</a>&mdash;</b>The Taurus <img alt="taurus" src="images/taurus.gif" /> Sub-Luma influences
those born from April 20th to May
19th inclusive, in all years. The best forms
of its expression would be along the lines
of Drama; management of Music and Public
Entertainment in a comprehensive way;
Engineers, especially engaged in constructing
extensive earth works, hydraulics, civil
engineering, etc.; precision work of all kinds, like
Chemistry, Medicine, Designing, Patterns and Models.
Taurus <img alt="taurus" src="images/taurus.gif" /> people frequently succeed quite well as managers
of large estates and large farms.</p>

<p class="konubas">ASTRAL CLASSIFICATION</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><b>Principal Planet Venus</b> <img alt="venus" src="images/venus.gif" /></p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p026_q" id="anch_p026_q">q</a>&mdash;</b>Venus <img alt="venus" src="images/venus.gif" /> is the planet of love and beauty. It
strengthens the affections and it will make the social
side of your nature active and strong. You are warmhearted
and companionable, fond of the society of
friends and relatives, of a loving and peaceable disposition,
and favoring all that is harmonious and refined.
You are fond of ease and comfort, of pleasure and
luxury, and you may need to exercise some restraint
over this side of your nature. Venus generally gives
those who are born under it good taste and a love of
beauty, of fine surroundings, clothes, ornaments, decorations,
and an appreciation of neatness and orderliness.
You probably have the ability to develop the
aesthetic side of your nature in the direction of singing,
music, art, poetry, etc., if you care to do so. The
influence of this planet can also be adapted to a business
life, as it gives some financial ability and good
luck. The disposition is usually cheerful, hopeful and
good natured, and brings popularity and many friends.<br /><br /></p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p027_s" id="anch_p027_s">s</a>&mdash;</b>Taurus <img alt="taurus" src="images/taurus.gif" /> is the head sign of the earthly triplicity,
a negative and fixed sign, and second of the
Zodiac. You have a strong character, dogmatic and
set in your ways, but usually sacrifice much to attain.
You are very much interested in all psychic things, yet
strongly inclined to materialism. Learn to trust your
own intuitions and judgments, and do not allow the
opinions of others to sway you. Love affairs take up a
great part of your thoughts at present, but as you grow
older they will be subordinated to their proper place in
your life, and your marriage is destined to be very
happy. Mentally you have a great deal of power, but
desire is very often stronger than the will, and will express
your mentality in a very matter-of-fact manner,
as you seem to delight in being what you term "practical."
In other words, you are more objective.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p027_t" id="anch_p027_t">t</a>&mdash;</b>You have distinct talent for the stage, and at
times feel you would enjoy a Bohemian existence, but
at other times know you prefer a solid comfort at home
to all the hotel life and travel the stage would entail.
You lift heavy burdens from the shoulders of others,
out of mere kindness--with no thought of return from
them, and yet out of mere kindness you are surprised
at the ingratitude with which your efforts are received.
You are fond of the opposite sex, but as a whole, rather
than of individuals. You will form one or two strong
attachments, which will have the effect of changing
your life. In money matters, you will be moderately
successful.</p>
<!-- Page 27} -->

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p028_u" id="anch_p028_u">u</a>&mdash;</b>You have a strong constitution and a great
deal of magnetic power, and tend to suffer from too
much life, rather than too little, and are therefore in
danger of apoplexy and such ailments, unless you use
your natural healing powers on yourself. You always
have better health when you are throwing off some of
your magnetism, and in this respect, it is best for you
not to become too reserved, or secretive, so that your
forces may be liberated to benefit others, as well as
yourself. Judged from the house of love and marriage,
some trouble in connection with those affairs
is shown. But at the same time, as the sign Taurus
<img alt="taurus" src="images/taurus.gif" /> is in close relation to the Second House, the House
of finances, this is an indication that you should gain
financially and socially through your marriage, but this
appears more along the lines of finance than through
reciprocal affection. To be successful and happy in
marriage, you should choose a partner born between
August the 22nd and September 2nd.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><b>Relativity of Taurus</b> <img alt="taurus" src="images/taurus.gif" /> <b>and Number 2</b></p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p028_v" id="anch_p028_v">v</a>&mdash;</b>The Taurus <img alt="taurus" src="images/taurus.gif" />, or second Sub-Luma, is under
the secondary influence of the 2 space, the Son Luma.
Taurus <img alt="taurus" src="images/taurus.gif" /> often shows its occult nature in the Bearing
of the King's Tithes. Aquarius <img alt="aquarius" src="images/aquarius.gif" />, the 11th sign, is also
under the 2 vibration indirectly as 1 and 1 make 2.</p>

<b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p028_w" id="anch_p028_w">w</a>&mdash;Second House&mdash;</b>Taurus <img alt="taurus" src="images/taurus.gif" /> influence.
The Spirit focuses in Venus <img alt="venus" src="images/venus.gif" />,
planet of love; this House or year pertains
to money matters, ventures in vacant land
and large real estate transactions, property,
etc. Its tendency is to be a good
money year and rather a disrupted domestic
year, easily tainted by jealously. These figures of
the age next birthday, giving the House or Cycle, apply
to persons, cities, nations, etc., and will be more elaborately
worked out in the further studies in the Enumeration.<br /><br /></p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p029_x" id="anch_p029_x">x</a>&mdash;</b>The Second House has largely to do with
wealth, finance and similar situations. Therefore in
passing through this House, such matters will be
brought to the fore. You may now expect favors from
influential patrons and helpful friendships, but they
will be followed by misunderstandings, oftentimes.
There are many advantages to be gained at this time,
as this is a good year for pecuniary interests. However,
some difficulties in business and love affairs will
be experienced, and hidden enemies will also effect
your position. Great care should be used in lending
any money or making investments of trust, as they will
not come duly to hand. There is also danger of being
betrayed or robbed, and if you can take the right advantage,
you can nearly always find ways and means
to increase your income, either through judicious investments
or engaging the mind in general financial
affairs to your own benefit.<br /><br /></p>

Chart of the Lumanus), known to some as
the Holy Ghost, the Paracleet, etc., is always
an indwelling Presence, separated
purposely from the body and body mind
by the Creative Christ Consciousness, the
Lord or Soul, because the carnal mind of
the body is not subject to the law, or vibrations
of God, neither, indeed, can be.
Our God, being the intense pressure of all
Creation, is a consuming fire. (Rom. 8:
7, 8. Heb. 12:29.) The words Spirit of
God total to the number 3.</p>

most likely; dreaminess without practical application,
diffusion and waste of time, hoping things will "turn
up."</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p031_e" id="anch_p031_e">e</a>&mdash;</b>The planet of 3 is Jupiter <img alt="jupiter" src="images/jupiter.gif" />; the sign of 3 is
Gemini <img alt="gemini" src="images/gemini.gif" />. A prominent C in your name means your
Soul will naturally turn to Spiritual things; a prominent
L gives you power to teach or lecture; a prominent U
inclines you to spiritualize in the use of your body, to be
esthetic.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p032_f" id="anch_p032_f">f</a>&mdash;3 as a Soul Path Number</b> shows that you
chose the artistic in your expressions. Form, size, color
and weight, artistically combined, will always be a delight
to you and should be sought by you. Even in the
most humble surroundings, you must try to have things
neat and clean and as far as possible, artistic. Yours
is the planning, the dreaming part of life, and it is all
right for you to dream on, if you can attach your
dreams in a practical way to the day's work.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p032_g" id="anch_p032_g">g</a>&mdash;3 as a Personality Number</b> is likely to bring
you a soft, gentle voice of some considerable power,
an artistic perception, broad mental vision and much
tolerance of the other person's viewpoint. Do not allow
this part of your Personality to run away with you,
so that you imagine yourself to be so "spiritual" that
the rest of the world is beneath you, that your beautiful
"dreams" are too deep or too mysterious for the
common people.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p032_h" id="anch_p032_h">h</a>&mdash;3 as a Predominant Name Number</b> means
that you will be likely to attract to yourself other
dreamers and planners. You should select with care
only those who have actually accomplished something,
not the bragging "will-be" types. Absorb the imaginations
and dreams of your companions, only to find a
practical way to put them out into some form of expression
that will reach all the people possible.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p032_j" id="anch_p032_j">j</a>&mdash;3 as a Destiny Number</b> means you have chosen
a destiny in this life that is capable of leading you to
the heights in some artistic form of expression. It is up
to you to find what this is, whether it is painting, music,
sculpture, literature, designing, acting, journalism, reformer
or physician; and then, STAY WITH YOUR
ONE OBJECTIVE until you arrive.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p032_jj" id="anch_p032_jj">jj</a>&mdash;3 as a Public Appearance Number.</b> This
brings in a scattering of energies, but of a good kind as
in the case of a great orator, actor or singer. In the
matter of gaining fame or fortune, you should always
strive more to the making of MORE money, a LARGER
income, rather than toward too much economy or savor
what you do get. Put your mind on just HOW you
will SPEND your income IN THE DIRECTION OF
YOUR GREAT OBJECTIVE ONLY. Remember,
"there is that which scattereth, yet tendeth to increase."

the senses. It gives you good mental ability, ingenuity

probably a good memory. You should be apt at speech
and argument, plausible and of substantial fluency in
conversation; but along with this there sometimes goes
a degree of subtlety and secrecy, as well as reserve or
retirement. Your whole nature will seldom be shown
to the world, and there will be one side which you will
never show even to your most intimate friends. Your
mind is active but a little lacking in concentration and
perseverance, and you are likely to occupy yourself

cram of which is rendered a permanent possession of
the Ego as wisdom. You deal best with publishers,

are careful, methodical and prudent. A good manager,
and you have a strong musical talent, and could
probably compose, if you studied seriously. You are
quiet and reserved, preferring to sit by yourself in a
corner with a book, but this will never make you any
money. You must make a point of keeping your word,
as nothing is more important in life than to have this
reputation. Learn to give yourself freely; only by loving
do we win love. Do not be sarcastic to others, they
shrink from you. You are short-sighted only to your

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p035_w" id="anch_p035_w">w</a>&mdash;</b>You are likely to go to the extreme in everything
you do, always hunting for occupation and anxious
to go, and to do something, you know not what,

explain. You are given to regrets, are very suspicious
and very untruthful. You must learn patience and
silence, keep the conversation free from personality,
remembering that heaven is within the temple of the
human breast, and not outside of it. You must learn
continuity and consistence, and you should never permit
yourself to do the acts you have condemned in
others; you should firmly resolve never to complain or
murmur, as this habit increases with practice to an
awful extent; you are brilliant and usually show to

ascendant, causes great restlessness and desire of
change. This planet is the chief ruler of the mental
faculties, and great care must be taken to note what
aspect he forms with other planets, for on that will
chiefly depend the mental dispositions of your nature.
The planet is termed "The Messenger of the Gods,"

knowledge, memory and the carrying of

bring to your attention many things concerning

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p036_a" id="anch_p036_a">a</a>&mdash;</b>The Third House relates to short journeys,
brethren and relatives and it effects all mental conditions,
stimulating to greater and more extensive
thought; will create troubles and may cause strife and
so injure the interests. There will be a tendency to
brood over conditions, desiring to alter in some way the
environment in which you are placed. This position
never fails to bring or give some restlessness, while it
also brings one into contact very closely with persons
who have some claim upon them. You should control
well as the feelings are at a high tension, and are,
therefore, likely to be easily effected. For one cannot
be too careful to avoid disgrace of both wealth and
friends, or their plausibility will put you much at their
mercy.<br /><br /></p>

the fears, the agitation, the raising of the EMOTIONS,
in the struggle to attain to the eternal life, which the
intellect perceives the Soul to have. The body and
body mind have a strong animal desire to go on forever
in the body. The Soul knows that this was never intended,
yet nearly all religions teach a literal resurrection
of the body. Paul says this body DIES. (1 Cor.
15:35-38.)</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p040_m" id="anch_p040_m">m</a>&mdash;</b>Intellect is afraid of death, for that is the end

of the Soul state into the intellectual state when they
became <b>organized</b> and began to build fine buildings,
own property, control temperal lives and affairs and
continue their errors by teaching a fleshly resurrection.
Thus religion lost its true state, the original Truth (seen

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p041_n" id="anch_p041_n">n</a>&mdash;</b>When man projected himself into a Physical
Body (space 4 on the Chart of the Lumanus), the Trinity
was demonstrated on earth, that is, the Spirit (value
1), and Soul (value 4), and Body (value 1) total 6.
Man could never have recognized the Creative God in
His fullness, unless man first descended into the depths
of a Physical Body (value 4), (space 4 on the Chart of
the Lumanus), which would not and could not vibrate
to the God vibrations, although the God-vibration
should vibrate through IT. Thus man in the Spirit, and
Soul, and Body trinity is able to get a comprehension
of the Holy Trinity of the Father-Mother God (value
1) and the Creative Christ Consciousness (value 2) and
the Spirit of God (value 3) (spaces 1 and 2 and 3 on
the Chart of the Lumanus). These are commonly,
though erroneously, treated as a combined Trinity in
the expression "Father, Son and Holy Ghost." There
should ALWAYS be a pause, at least to the extent of
the word "and" between each two of the names. (1
Thess. 5:23. Heb. 4:12.)</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p041_nn" id="anch_p041_nn">nn</a>&mdash;</b>Thus the Soul projects itself into this world
to take on an EARTHLY Body, Earthly Intellect, Earthly
Thoughts, Habits and Brain. It has use for all these
and they are not evil. When it has cut its curve
through this earth plane life as a part of its great curve
through Eternity, it DROPS the body and Body Mind
with all its Intellect, Ideas, Inventions, Hopes, Fears,
Triumphs, and Joys, and goes ON as a Soul (Sub-Lumas
Aries <img alt="aries" src="images/aries.gif" /> to Pisces <img alt="pisces" src="images/pisces.gif" /> on the Chart of the
Lumanus), still along the lines of its eternal circuit,
adding the experiences of this plane to its GROWTH,
but NOT changing its COURSE on account of the earth
life.</p>

the things that will reach the greatest possible

labor, in the working out of the God plan within you,
but it is also the path of great rewards and a steady

famous as a writer on certain technical subjects,
especially some of the "how" types of books for some
such trades as engineer, chemist, electrician, cabinetmaker,
builder, architect, manager, merchant, teacher,
business man or military ideals. At any of these trades

you to convince your public of your honesty and sincerity.
You must take the part of a "good fellow" a
good mixer. You are naturally adapted to come before
the general public, the common people. You
should be especially careful to so school yourself that
you will be able to "walk with kings, yet not lose the
common touch."</p>

<p>Your best and most profitable public appearances

that because he really is an earnest worker, that
he is the ONLY one. When 4 obtains too much authority,
he is likely to be a type of bully and conceited person.
Do your work every day, looking to advancement,

apply the principle of COHESION.</p>

<p>In the First Chapter of Genesis we read that
on the FOURTH Day the Principle of COHESION was
applied, by the placing of the stars and the lights in
the Firmament. We learn that they were placed there,
on the FOURTH day for FOUR reasons: for SIGNS,
for seasons, for days and for years. This is recorded
in the FOURTEENTH verse. FOUR is the number of
struggle and of strength exerted. COHESION, as we
said, leads to STRENGTH.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p043_x" id="anch_p043_x">x</a>&mdash;</b>In this life the Enumerator learns HOW to
gain strength by making his plans hang together
around one idea, in other words by exerting the Principle
of COHESION, the binding together. The Enumerator
knows that no man liveth to himself and no
man dieth to himself, therefore the real strength of any
plan is in working WITH those who will effect that
plan. To bind together by the bonds of love and of
mutual interest, which is the strongest COHESION.</p>

You are attractive, clever, and very magnetic, a good

have a good eye to the main chance, and will make
much money. You have a good head for detail of all
kinds, yet at the same time, you are capable of carrying
out big enterprises. Usually you are a little too close

on occasion, and be a little more frank and open in
your dealings with others. You are diligent, observing

Learn to trust your intuitions more and place reliance
in the guidance of your affectional nature. You are
naturally passionate, rather than affectionate. The
strong point in your nature, is your determination, and
this trait you may use to bolster up all the others. You

the personal or domestic environment, residence, and
family conditions. This will cause you to feel vibrations
that you were not conscious of before. You may
be apt to be somewhat depending upon the help of
others at this time. These years indicate a time when
the attachments of the opposite sex are likely to go
wrong and affairs of the heart become upset, or deranged.
Disappointments, especially in connection
with domestic affairs, are indicated and also disputes
with superiors and acquaintances, with separations and
estrangements. It is, in fact, a year when many things
go wrongly. But viewed from a higher standpoint, this
is a good influence, for it quickens the personality and
calls out all its strength to battle with the changing
conditions. For the changes, although apparently disastrous,
are eventually for good.<br /><br /></p>

lead but to bitter disappointment and regrets.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p051_t" id="anch_p051_t">t</a>&mdash;5 as a Destiny Number</b> shows that your soul
has determined to try out all manner of temptations.
So strong is the influence that about all you can do
about it is to "pray that your flight be not in the winter,"
that is, that you will not have to make your decisions
as to which way to go when in the MIDST of a
temptation, but that you will have foresight and forewarning
enough to know just what to do and DO it that
way. You thus vibrate to the Destiny of ups and
downs, and will do best in something that involves
much travel, variety and change. You crave the
chance to bring forth with originality and novelty. You
will therefore find a pleasant destiny if you follow
some such occupation as writer, teacher of Psychology,
humorist, entertainer or linguist.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p051_tt" id="anch_p051_tt">tt</a>&mdash;5 as a Public Appearance Number.</b> Versatility
of appearance is seen here. You would make a
good actor or teacher along specialized lines. You
would do well in appearing as a humorist or eccentric
speaker. Your public appearance will be much helped
by a fair knowledge of languages and a good pronunciation
of words. You should get a good dictionary and
keep it handy. Increase your vocabulary by having a
regular habit of referring to the dictionary each time
you are in doubt about the pronunciation, meaning or
spelling of any word. Jot them down on a slip of paper
till you can get to your dictionary.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p051_u" id="anch_p051_u">u</a>&mdash;Warning To Number 5.</b> Your entire struggle
and downfall is in your own hands! If you do not
make the brilliant success you should it will be because
of your own self-indulgence, extremes in action or
abuse of your opportunities and the breaking of friendships
that would have helped you. Live at your highest
powers, or you will sink to the lowest depths!
There is practically no middle road.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p051_v" id="anch_p051_v">v</a>&mdash;</b>The Fifth Principle of Creation is DISCARD

who could be conscious of the Principle of DISCARD,
when came the need to DISCARD their young; to DISCARD
their enemies and those who should be detrimental
to them. The greater their CONSCIOUS perception
of the principle of DISCARD, the greater has
been their HONOR among the animals, the more intelligence
they have shown.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p053_e" id="anch_p053_e">e</a>&mdash;</b>The Sun <img alt="sun" src="images/sun.gif" /> is Ruler, and the Lord of the
Heavens on these dates, and it stands as the symbol of
vitality and activity of your mind, intellect, love and
feeling. And by studying the great creation of the
Solar System, in the Seven Principles and their application
to the five planes (pages 68 to 77), you will be in a
position where you can co-operate with your God, and
create your own environment. There is a certain time
in your life, when you seem lifted up on the wings of
Fate, which is the truth. You are your own Fate, your
own Destiny, as each soul is attracted to its appointed
place, and each has its own mission to fulfill. You are
given a time for pleasure, a time to rise, a time to fall,
and a time to die. Which proves that astrology does
exist in fact. All persons born under this Sign of the
Zodiac are naturally endowed with strong determination,
intuition and purpose, and if you will only persistently
hold on and not give up, you are sure to be
successful. You like change of scene and occupation,
and will spend hours of your time in learning new
things and working out new principles. Which is all
good for you, when not carried to extremes. You are
sympathetic, and tender-hearted, and often generous
to a fault.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p053_f" id="anch_p053_f">f</a>&mdash;</b>You must avoid pride, and not allow yourself
to become over-confident, though success will surely
come by this influence in the Future, for this is a fortunate
and more progressive portion of your life, and it
gives you many opportunities to expand your inherited
characteristics. With few exceptions, all persons born
under the constellation of these planets have in their
hearts, a pure and true love for mankind. And the
motto that should hang in your room, is the Golden
Rule, for you have it in your power to do many great
and good things in this world; it has given you a
natural tendency toward the beautiful and artistic, as
some of the greatest scholars and students in the world
come out of this sign. A Leo <img alt="scorpio" src="images/scorpio.gif" /> person will nearly always
be found at the head of some great humane movement.
You would become very successful in the study
of Metaphysics or Occult science. As it would strengthen
your will power, and enlighten your mind, and give
you the knowledge and wisdom, which would enable
you to reach out and grasp the so-called secret powers
and forces. The Sun <img alt="sun" src="images/sun.gif" />, placed in the sign of Leo <img alt="scorpio" src="images/scorpio.gif" />
at your birth, promises much success in life, through
your own personal magnetism and power to adapt yourself
to circumstances. For a business or profession you
would excel in acting, or in an occupation that ministers
to the Joy and Pleasures of others. You were born on
a fortunate date, and it is up to you, to make good.</p>

the planet of Life, as the ruling planet of

speculation and the joys of life; love

Your own career will become more prominent also.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p054_j" id="anch_p054_j">j</a>&mdash;</b>The Fifth House is concerned with speculative
affairs and all matters of enterprise and activity
prompted by the desire of nature, and it therefore tends
to waken the emotions in connection with love affairs,
children, pleasure, generally, and even games of
hazard, gambling or business enterprises. It is a good
year to engage in investment or speculation, or enjoyment
and merry-making of all sorts. It will give an
opportunity to be more magnanimous and generous, to
act kindly and to be more noble and high-spirited and
will cause you to exert every possible effort to please.
This will bring opportunities for love adventures, unions
or lasting attachments, which will be helpful and
fortunate and will cause you to obtain advancement
through providential help. The placing of affection
will create enmities, which will be attributed to a false
friend or envious minds of some of the associates who
will prove unfaithful and treacherous.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>

In a few months, the baby's body

you will laugh at the folly of the worry you enjoy so
now. Learn to LIVE RIGHT NOW ONLY and NOT

making something better of your life. As you go on
to better things through using this Principle of TRANSMUTATION
you do indeed come to GLORY, its
natural result.</p>

<p>On the Sixth Day, in the Genesis account of Creation,
the earth went through the Principle of TRANSMUTATION.
It was transmuted from a chaos into a
habitable thing; from the habitation of great and awful
beasts to the habitation of man. And the GLORY of
that TRANSMUTATION was Man.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p060_z" id="anch_p060_z">z</a>&mdash;</b>The Enumerator learns here that we go thru
a TRANSMUTATION period all our lives. Our Souls
transmute particles of earth through our mothers'
bodies into our baby bodies; then we transmute our
baby bodies into youth bodies; our youth bodies into
mature bodies and come to the GLORY in each phase,
by transmuting the clay into the living Temple of God
during the whole time. Finally, realizing the completion
of the problems that we came to solve, few or
many, in a long life or a short one, we pass on to other
parts of GLORY that we are ready for, having been
through our periods of TRANSMUTATION.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p060_c" id="anch_p060_c">c</a>&mdash;</b>Mercury's <img alt="mercury" src="images/mercury.gif" /> influence is over the brain and
nerves, and it has more to do with the mind than with
the senses. It gives you good mental ability, ingenuity
and adaptability, fertility of resource and wit, and
probably a good memory. You should be apt at speech
and argument, plausible and of substantial fluency in
conversation; but along with this there sometimes goes
a degree of subtlety and secrecy, as well as reserve or
retirement. Your whole nature will seldom be shown
to the world, and there will be one side which you will
never show even to your most intimate friends. Your
mind is active but a little lacking in concentration and
perseverance, and you are likely to occupy yourself
with too many subjects, to change a little too rapidly,
and to have too many irons in the fire. You can adapt
yourself readily to the moods and opinions of people,
and can see truth under quite opposite disguises.</p>

accurate and discriminating, and this natural tendency
is manifested in various phases of your character.
Your self-assumed knowledge of what is fitting and
proper makes you fond of arranging matrimonial alliances,
amongst your friends and associates. You
have a keen foresight, and you are quite positive and
decisive and like to execute your own ideas. Vocations
and professions best adapted for persons born on this
date, according to the vibrations of the Planets, would
be dealing with the Public, in the amusement line, or
on the stage, as you should be gifted with a good flow
of language and plenty of art and wit, which would
make you a good entertainer; as a rule you should be
of a fascinating personality, especially to those of the
Opposite Sex, which will cause you to be reckless in
your pursuit of pleasure and in gratifying your desires.
Trifling affairs, of absolutely no consequence sometimes
cause you deep distress.</p>

causes your feelings to be easily hurt, or perhaps it is
truer to say that your vanity is easily wounded. You
are always hopeful and strong, and recover quickly
from disappointments, so that losses and disasters do
not have very much effect on you. Some of our most
powerful and talented orators and emotional actors,
possessing the true genius of eloquence, who have acquired
great tact and taste, in the use of language, were
born on this date. You are rather whimsical, and see
the humorous side of things. You have a keen sense of
humor and see the fun in a thing, when others should
not see it at all. You like the luxuries of life and like
the best of everything. You cannot stand being poor,
and will make every effort to better yourself, and can
do an extraordinary amount of work; you are accurate
and painstaking in all that you do. You are literary
and fond of books.</p>

during the month of May. You demand much of
those you love, but are willing to give much in return.
You can adapt yourself to the circumstances over
which you have no control, yet you like the best to be
had in any line of things. You adore personal freedom
and it is very difficult for you to submit to the rule of
anybody. When you are permitted to have your own

and tends to bring some sickness or indisposition of a
serious nature, unless careful attention is paid to
hygiene, and care should be taken to keep the health
in good order, so that the influences now operating
have no power of impairing health. It is altogether not
a fortunate period, so far as worldly progress goes, and
you will be likely to make mistakes at this time, especially
with regard to inferiors or those who are of a
lower social standing which will cause annoyance,
probably through some indiscretion. Over this, you
will worry and give way to anxiety and so will be subject
to nervous troubles. You will be somewhat suspicious
or mistrustful and in consequence thereof, will
suffer some discredit and may lose friends and reputation.
Therefore, these planets warn you to have your
eyes open and your ears on the alert.</p>

This word has a value of 43. 4 and 3 are 7.
The color of the 7 space is the deep Purple, the color of the Midnight Silences.
When the 2, in most printed figures, is turned upside down, it makes
a 7. When Creative Christ Consciousness reverses itself and appears in the human
form, it is the inner soul or secret place of the Most High in man. This you will experience
in your deep and secret attainment of the Inner Silences, when you have
learned to "present your body a LIVING sacrifice, HOLY and acceptable unto
GOD," including your time, powers, means and possessions, the Tithes of the
2 demonstrated in the 7. The letters under the 7 are G, P and Y, meaning GOD'S
PERPETUAL YOUTHFULNESS. When you attain much to the Secret Place,
through Spiritual study in the Enumeration, and many Silences, "He shall renew
thy YOUTH as the eagle's." The 7 space is the center of the cross of Life, the very
depth of sacrifice, in the Spirit and Soul and Body, that they may be perpetually
"preserved blameless unto the coming (into consciousness) of the Lord Jesus Christ." (2)</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p065_nn" id="anch_p065_nn">nn</a>&mdash;</b>A conspicuous 7 in your name or birthdate
means that you will be likely to have a deep psychic
instinct, a tendency to refinement, love of flowers and
nature's beauties, that you love to be waited on and
served, feeling a kind of hidden priesthood within you,
and mysterious unexplored parts of your mind and nature.
Faults to be avoided; laziness, poetic fancies
without basis, small tyranny, peevishness. The planet
of 7 is the Moon <img alt="moon" src="images/moon.gif" /> increasing; the sign of 7 is Libra <img alt="libra" src="images/libra.gif" />.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p065_p" id="anch_p065_p">p</a>&mdash;</b>The letter G in your name means a love of
vague and mystic sensations in the body; the letter P
in your name means constancy in all your desires, if not
so much in your actions; Y means a self-centered attempt
to keep yourself young at all hazards, sometimes
remarkably successful.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p066_q" id="anch_p066_q">q</a>&mdash;7 as a Soul Path Number</b> shows that you chose
a pathway of material completion for this earthlife.
It is an incarnation in which you contemplate many of
your past achievements in other incarnations. It is a
cycle in which a great deal will be brought to you in
the line of your wishes, if you learn and use the vibrations
possible to you in the way of attractive forces
within you.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p066_r" id="anch_p066_r">r</a>&mdash;7 as a Personality Number</b> tends to make you
easy to wait upon, to have things brought to you; it
makes you do better in the refined things of life, rather
than the labor and more sordid things. You show a
refined, nice type of personality and will be the center
of attention, if you will use the refined ideas within you.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p066_s" id="anch_p066_s">s</a>&mdash;7 as a Predominant Name Number</b> shows that
you will attract to yourself those who do things and
who delight to serve. You will attract to yourself also
those who are in power and will desire to make use of
your natural wisdom as a counsellor or "power behind
the throne," for themselves or their principles.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p066_t" id="anch_p066_t">t</a>&mdash;7 as a Destiny Number</b> shows that you will
live rather a secluded life and should you enter any
large business will not likely appear as the head of that
business, yet be known on the inside as one who is an
unseen force or power in that business, very useful but
not very visible. One of the best ways to work out your
real destiny is to take up one of the following lines, or
something allied to them that may suit you. By thus
doing what you love to do you will soon become known
for your skill, after which your wisdom will have a
chance to demonstrate itself. You are best fitted along
the lines of artshop management, florist, horticulturist,
clergyman, organist or writer.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p066_tt" id="anch_p066_tt">tt</a>&mdash;7 as a Public Appearance Number.</b> This
gives you a keen penetrative ability in dealing with
persons or groups of persons. You can quickly discern
the next thing coming, for you will sense their thoughts
and know how to answer. If you will apply this to
looking for the positive and agreeable thought-line, in
the direction of the object you have with that person
or group, you will win. Do NOT look for the resistance
they may put up against the idea you are putting over,
but seek the reason why THEY will benefit. Never
mind how much you wish to sell the idea.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p066_u" id="anch_p066_u">u</a>&mdash;Warning To Number 7.</b> Be careful of an exaggerated
sensitiveness on your part. Even if you cannot
fully express your kindly feelings, continue to be
friendly and associate yourself with others. Avoid, at
all cost, any tendency to retire to lonely places, or anything
that would make you a hermit or a recluse. "The
best study of mankind is man," so stay where you can
HELP others by your fine sense of wisdom, or even the
occult. You are naturally psychic and the world needs
that talent, even if at times it does seem unappreciative
of your display of it.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><b>The Seventh Principle of Creation</b></p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p067_v" id="anch_p067_v">v</a>&mdash;</b>The Seventh Principle of Creation is SPIRITUALITY.
SPIRITUALITY, properly exerted, leads to
BLESSING.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p067_w" id="anch_p067_w">w</a>&mdash;</b>SPIRITUALITY applies to all phases of your
health, your mind, your money matters and your perception
of Soul, whether you know it or not and
whether you are knowingly religious or not. The kindly
thought, the gentle word, the benevolent action, all
are the result of the Principle of SPIRITUALITY active
in YOU, whether you seem to be giving the kindness or
receiving it. Thru this Principle of SPIRITUALITY
comes all the BLESSING that can be known to man or
beast. Without this Principle of SPIRITUALITY life
on earth would be unlivable.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p067_x" id="anch_p067_x">x</a>&mdash;</b>On the Seventh Day God rested from ALL
His labor which He had made. This statement is in
chapter 2 of Genesis. 2 makes a good 7 when turned
upside down. After this Seventh Principle of
SPIRITUALITY was brought into being, God never
labored any more. It is the culmination of all the
Seven Principles and no further labor is needed. It
signifies the working of all the LAW which God did
make and nothing further can be added. Therefore
God does not need to attend to any further detail of
Creation; for by this Seventh Principle Creation operates
itself. (Gen. 2: 2. Heb. 4: 1 to 5. See also Romans
14:5, 6.)</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p067_y" id="anch_p067_y">y</a>&mdash;</b>The Enumerator learns now that it is not his
effort or his strength of mind or body that brings things
to pass, but that it is the ability to meditate, to come to
the Principle of SPIRITUALITY, that brings the
BLESSING of success and attainment. We learn here
too, "that which God doeth is perfect, no man can add
thereto and no man can take therefrom." When we
come to this Principle of SPIRITUALITY we have the
BLESSING of that perfect peace which passeth all understanding.</p>

the heavenly glory and the earthly servant-hood. In
the garden of Gethsemane He is represented as making
another great Choice between the Body mind fears and
the fulfillment of His great mission, the conquering of
Death (2). This is an example of the Law that like

is made up of the elements of the universe.
These elements blend and hold to their kind and to
each other. This holding together is called Cohesion
and is what gives the body its Strength. When we get
fearful we are moving contrary to the law as touching
upon Cohesion and we reduce our own Strength. The

law relating to Cohesion, by getting others to work

the most motherly of signs, represents motherhood
when called upon to make one of its greatest sacrifices
in manifesting the law of Rejection or Discard. Mother
must give up her boy or her girl, that they may go out
into the world. It is a law, from the great whales in
the sea to the eagle in her nest; from the oyster under
the ocean to the king upon his throne. When that law

then you must stop your help. If you cannot help them
in a way that they can be caused to compensate, then

have been far happier if that mother had studied this
law of Discard from his babyhood, making him do
everything possible for himself, even if it did take more
time and effort than to do it for him. You can also see
little, hardworking sisters supporting big, overgrown,
lazy brothers, who work on that sisters sympathies;

of Morality, the Morality from within. Great men and
women have not become so because they were total
abstainers from things immoral, but because they controlled
their emotions and subverted their personal
feelings to the great object in hand, their life's mission.
They being superior to the call of self, were
neither moral nor immoral, but Unmoral, that is, they
had perfect freedom, coupled with superb control,
without supression. So they proved that ALL Honor
must come from the Honor within, the Honor of the

Libra <img alt="libra" src="images/libra.gif" />, the Scales in astrological
understanding, is a fit symbol for Transmutation,
the sixth Principle of Creation, in that through Transmutation
things come to a balance. Strife ceases. The
struggles are Transmuted to success; the house becomes
a tranquil home; the idea through travail and
long struggle to express, becomes the great ideal.
Venus <img alt="venus" src="images/venus.gif" />, the planet of love and art, is the balance of
life and the great transmuting force in the world.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p071_u" id="anch_p071_u">u</a>&mdash;</b>This struggle leading to tranquility; the long

thoughts are directly or indirectly connected with sex.
All religions have had a basis of it, from the most ancient

that it includes sex.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p072_y" id="anch_p072_y">y</a>&mdash;</b>To neutralize this it is useless to fight it. Resist
not the so-called evil, but take the ground that
Nothing is evil in the temple of the living God,
"which Temple ye ARE." "Your BODY IS the Temple
of the living God," and no part or function or appetite
of that Temple is evil. Sex is a divine institution. So
are water and fire. And either one of the three will
destroy you if wrongly applied. Yet each of them
promotes and causes life. It is the MISUSE of the
functions of the body that destroys us, not the function
as such. (See Paul's wonderful expositions of this
truth in 1 Cor. 3:16 and 17; 6:19 and 20; 7:34 and 36.
2 Cor. 6:16.)</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p072_z" id="anch_p072_z">z</a>&mdash;</b>After all it is the Subconscious (7) or Soul
Mind in us that determines the direction of our progress
to a large extent. When we are in right attunement
to that Subconscious (7) we come to the Blessing
of that perfect liberty, we find souls of like nature,
we are no longer restrained or fearful of man made
laws and conventions. We LIVE the life of perfect
freedom, in perfect control without restraint or fear.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><b>Relativity</b></p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p072_a" id="anch_p072_a">a</a>&mdash;</b>Taking this Table of the Seven Principles as
a whole, we find that the first three spaces, 1, 2 and
3, are ABOVE their basic planetary influences. This
symbolizes the fact that the Father-Mother God (1)
the Creative Christ Consciousness (2) and the Spirit of
God (3) all manifest in us SUPERIOR to the law, that
they are the makers of law, that law is beneath them
as only a form of expression. For this reason the
Christ, knowing ALL law, could do things that were
beyond any perception of law that men had, hence they
called His works miracles.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p072_b" id="anch_p072_b">b</a>&mdash;</b>We see that Cohesion and Rejection, or Discard,
are horizontal to the planetary influences symbolized
by the signs in the second circle from the I AM
center. This shows that when we have not deliberately
known and become superior to the planetary influences
in the planes of the Physical Body (4) and the
plane of Morality (5) we will be moved by those planetary
influences just as the animals are. The less we
know of them, the more they move us, just as is true
with any other natural force.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p072_c" id="anch_p072_c">c</a>&mdash;</b>Transmutation and Spirituality, the Divinity

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p073_d" id="anch_p073_d">d</a>&mdash;</b>These laws manifest through the great Law,
as planetary influences, as environment signified by the
planetary influences and by many other things not so
easily understood.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p073_e" id="anch_p073_e">e</a>&mdash;</b>This Table also shows that the positive or
right side, the giving side, of life is indicated by Force,
Order, Rejection (Discard) and Spirituality. These
are masculine traits, four in number, affecting the
Physical Body (4) and the Soul (4) signified on the
other side of the Table.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p073_f" id="anch_p073_f">f</a>&mdash;</b>On the negative or feminine side, the receiving
side, we have Choice, Cohesion and Transmutation.
In these two sides we see the eternal struggle between
the male, positive, masculine and the female, negative,
feminine. The Male (4) with his four positive qualities,
desires the female (6) with her three negative
qualities, thus clashing the feminine number four (the
number of his qualities) with her masculine number
three (the number of her qualities). To offset this,
she doubles her qualities, through her intuitions and
inner perceptions, especially during pregnancy or gestation.
Doubling the 3 by having the power of her
own triune being outside, she often contains another
triune being, her child, inside, thus doubling the 3,
making her the mystic value of the 6, the female (6).</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p073_g" id="anch_p073_g">g</a>&mdash;</b>When the male (4) and the female (6) are
united "they twain shall become ONE flesh," 4 and 6

<p class="konubas">THE MYSTIC TRINITIES</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p073_h" id="anch_p073_h">h</a>&mdash;</b>Another mystic application of the trinity is
seen in this Table, in combining the two bases of any
one space with its apex or master space. For example:</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p073_j" id="anch_p073_j">j</a>&mdash;</b>Our perception of the Father-Mother God (1)
depends upon our perception of, and upon our having
had experiences with, the Divinity of Parenthood (6)
and the Subconscious (7). Force (the 1st principle)
must base its usefulness, its foundation, upon Transmutation
(6th principle) and upon Spirituality (7th principle).
If these are not included the Force becomes
destructive and destroys itself and its own usefulness.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p074_k" id="anch_p074_k">k</a>&mdash;</b>Creative Christ Consciousness (2) can only
manifest to us on earth, through Morality (5) and that
Morality (5) must manifest first in the Subconscious
(7). A Morality (5) based upon fear, or man made
laws, will never stand. (Romans 8). We also see
that Choice (2nd principle) always includes some
demonstration of Rejection or Discard (5th principle),
and Spirituality (7th principle). A little study will
show this even in the most material transactions.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p074_l" id="anch_p074_l">l</a>&mdash;</b>Spirit of God (3) demonstrates as life through
the Physical Body (4) which life includes physical
demonstration of love, leading to the Divinity of Parenthood
(6). The 3 of the Spirit of God manifestation is
duplicated in the 3 of the family, the father, mother
and child. It is the Spirit of God (3) that causes the
family to be, and Paul says that those who will "forbid
to marry", will be those who have DEPARTED from
the faith. (1 Tim. 4:3.)</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p074_m" id="anch_p074_m">m</a>&mdash;</b>Order (3rd principle) is only practical where
Cohesion (4th principle) and Transmutation (6th principle)
have combined to make things hold together and
to transform them from a chaotic state to an orderly
state. Remember then, that you can have Order only
where you have first established Cohesion and Transmutation
in principle.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p074_n" id="anch_p074_n">n</a>&mdash;</b>If your life is discordant or inharmonious,
look well to this. On the other hand Cohesion (4th
principle) looks upward to Order (3rd principle) and
over to Rejection or Discard (5th principle) for its
basis. We gain those qualities that make for strength
only if we have Order in our mind and can Discard
in our heart. They must be INSIDE, and not the result
of any command or fear thought from the outside.
They must be LAW and not some man made laws.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p074_p" id="anch_p074_p">p</a>&mdash;</b>Physical Body (4) to be at its best, must
study and submit to the Spirit of God (3) and Morality
(5). This does not always means suppression, but
may mean regulation, to bring about Order in time,
place and companionship, that none shall be injured by
your indulgences and that all shall be helped.</p>

only through the right application of that
inner Creative Christ Consciousness (2) through the
ideas, motives and acts of the Physical Body (4). A
Morality that depends upon someone's else opinion or
commands, or upon ANY book or outside influence for
its force, is not a Morality at all It is a mere regulation.

from motives of his very own.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p075_r" id="anch_p075_r">r</a>&mdash;</b>Conformably to this, we find that Rejection
(Discard) the 5th principle must reveal itself to us
through some Choice (2nd principle). To continue the
principle of Rejection or Discard, we must have and
maintain Cohesion (4th principle). We must stand by
our Choice, we must stay together with those involved
in that Choice and continue the Rejection or Discard
of those who are thus put in opposition.</p>

the great law as revealed through the Father-Mother
God (1) and the Spirit of God (3). Through this infinite
combination man reaches his First Omnipotent
Cross or Mark (the F, O and X of previous lessons).
Man is here first brought into the real divinity of himself,
by going outside of himself to find himself.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p075_t" id="anch_p075_t">t</a>&mdash;</b>Transmutation (6th principle) takes its
strength and power also from the combination of
Force (1st principle) and Order (3rd principle). We
can only Transmute things around us by using both
Force and Order. To use Force alone might make
more confusion by its destructive power. We must
proceed in an ORDERLY manner. Any new system,
whether politics, art or personal reform, must have
an orderly object and an orderly procedure toward
that object, to be a success. "Let all things be done
decently and in order." (1 Cor. 14:40.)</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p075_u" id="anch_p075_u">u</a>&mdash;</b>Man is always a triune being (1 Thess. 5:23)
and his Subconscious (7) or soul mind displays this.
We see in the Table that Subconscious (7) looks upward
toward the Father-Mother God (1) and the Creative
Christ Consciousness (2). Subconscious (7) is dependent
upon them. The Father-Mother God flows
down through the Creative Christ Consciousness, manifesting
in the STILL, SMALL voice. It requires the
Silences, the meditations, to know that "THIS is my
beloved Son, hear ye HIM." (Mark 9:7.) It is AFTER
the transfiguration, the Transmutation, of your life,
that you come into this close contact with the Beloved
Son, the Creative Christ Consciousness (2) the second
person in the Godhead, the second person in YOU,
your own Soul.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p078_f" id="anch_p078_f">f</a>&mdash;</b>Libra <img alt="libra" src="images/libra.gif" /> is the sign of the Scales, which makes
you just. You should have a good future; you inherit
brain power above the ordinary, and you will not be
doing justice to yourself unless you exert your brain
power to its fullest limit. "Concentrate" must be your
watchword. You are a psychic collector of thought,
having the ability to acquire the occult laws of nature.
Your view point is broad and liberal, and your knowledge
must be wide; try to know a little of everything,
but concentrate on doing one thing well; you are very
sympathetic, and people find it easy to confide in you;
in fact, many people take advantage of your good nature,
and impose on your time and patience. Soon you
will learn to assert yourself, and guide your affairs into
better channels for your own advancement. You are
very modest and do not properly value the gifts nature
has bestowed on you.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p078_g" id="anch_p078_g">g</a>&mdash;</b>You should strive for habits of order, even in
small things, and should take to heart the truth that
nothing is insignificant which promises the peace and
pleasure of others; you should curb your desire for
praise and appreciation, and never do a kind action
for the credit to be derived from it. You are a strong
lover, and you need love; you cannot go through life
alone. You accept proven fact, but are quick to see
any flimsiness in basic foundations. Sometimes you
show much excitability, and in this condition you may
make mistakes in judgment; you want to have your
own way, and generally succeed in having it, people
yield to you, through confidence in your integrity and
judgment, and well they may.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p078_h" id="anch_p078_h">h</a>&mdash;</b>You are devotedly attached to your home and
family, and never happy unless you are giving all your
friends a good time; you are fond of society only insofar
as you can give others pleasure; there is nothing
self-seeking about you. You will have many disappointments
in life, but always you will struggle gallantly
against the adverse conditions, and truly one who
never gives up the fight, may be said to win it. You
are just and fair in your dealings; you are conscientious,
true and careful in money matters. You have
great adaptability and fit into many conditions; you
are apt to be undecided and uncertain in your ways,
expending much effort sometimes before you are quite
certain just what it is that you are after. You are companionable,
sociable and you suffer much because you
cannot find things just as you wish. From your love of
investigating new things, you sometimes neglect your
best interests and special talents; you rush hither and
thither in search of excitement or new fields to explore,
and are frequently likened to the rolling stone which
gathers no moss, but remember it gathers polish.</p>

the planet of love and woman, art and

House chiefly extends to the separations,
divorces and dissolving of partnerships,
agreements, and marriages. The chief
thing to do during these years is to be
diplomatic and avoid disputes if it is possible. Some

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p079_l" id="anch_p079_l">l</a>&mdash;</b>The Seventh House is chiefly concerned with
marriage unions, partnerships, love affairs, law-suits,
litigations and opponents. During this year you are
likely to be brought in contact with others who will
greatly influence, and bring an entire change into your
life. You will find now that feelings and emotions
have a very satisfactory outlet, for it will make attachments
and engagements fruitful, and tend to bring all
matters concerning the affections to a satisfactory issue.
It is also good for finance and monetary prospects and
will bring gain, pleasure and profit in many directions,
and you will be wise to make the most out of this favorable
period. You will now come into new and congenial
surroundings, will make new friends and will
gain in many ways through others. You will now come
into very close contact with those to whom you will be
drawn by sympathy and affection and prospects will
look brighter and happier than they have for some
time. The social side of the nature will now be very
active. The mind will also be very susceptible of considerable
cultivation, especially in connection with the
more imaginative and idealistic subjects. Companionship,
friendship, partnership, association and unions
are the key notes at this period. But in a Horoscope

<!-- {Page 80 -->

having the Seventh House severely afflicted by malice
at their birth, then all associations will now require
great care with any relations, for there is a likelihood of
getting into trouble or disagreement at this time. Great
care would be necessary in dealing with those who
have a share in the affections, and also with regard to
all monetary interests.</p>

especially the word as spelled
$ucce$$. The color of the

Z, meaning the HIGHEST QUADRATIC
ZENITH. The highest double number

<p style="text-align:center;"><b>Personally</b></p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p083_nn" id="anch_p083_nn">nn</a>&mdash;</b>A conspicuous 8 in your name
or birthdate means that you are likely to
have some ability in public speaking or
teaching. It gives you powers of leadership,
success, and mental strength. Remember
that all these things are influences,
not fates, and that they in turn are
more or less offset by other numbers and letters. Faults
to be avoided are talking too much about self, headstrong
will, stubbornness, and thoughtless moves.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p083_p" id="anch_p083_p">p</a>&mdash;</b>The planet of 8 is Saturn <img alt="saturn" src="images/saturn.gif" />. The sign of 8 is
Scorpio <img alt="scorpio" src="images/scorpio.gif" />. The letter H in your name has a tendency
toward the Higher perception of your body's finest and
most spiritual uses; Q in your name is the eccentric,

strength of body and mind that can be used to advance
your earthly success.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p083_q" id="anch_p083_q">q</a>&mdash;8 as a Soul Path Number</b> shows that you have
chosen a pathway to bring about justice, that one of
your chief life aims will be to make justice, even sometimes
in cases where it does not directly concern you.
While doing this you also will feel at times the pangs
of fear at the justice that may be waiting you as well.
It will be a feeling that you too must meet a certain
great Judge. This Judge may materialize in your life
as an avenging reaction to something or someone you
have helped to reform.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p084_r" id="anch_p084_r">r</a>&mdash;8 as a Personality Number</b> will probably help
to put you into the front ranks of commerce, reform
movements, leadership in finance or big business.
Your Personality will be that of the Judge, the final
arbiter, the ranking master of all in banking or commercial
circles. Dignity is the strongest trait of your
personality and you will win in proportion as you are
able to impress people with your dignity without appearing
uppish or aloof or too imposing.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p084_s" id="anch_p084_s">s</a>&mdash;8 as a Predominant Name Number</b> shows that
you will naturally attract to yourself many who will
have fine ideas about reform movement but without
any executive ability to "put them over." This you
will be expected to do and many of your friends will
prove to be of little use to you because they desire to
use you to further their own pet schemes.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p084_t" id="anch_p084_t">t</a>&mdash;8 as a Destiny Number</b> makes you well able
to be a great executive, with a bent toward a powerful
public personality that will land you among the
leaders of the nation, if you use it and keep yourself
above the petty things. For this reason you must spend
time to complete your education if you possibly can, no
matter what your age. Keep in mind and constantly
exercise your powers as a leader, at first in whatever
ways may appear around you, then reach on to greater
things. Your natural Destiny is leadership.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p084_tt" id="anch_p084_tt">tt</a>&mdash;Public Appearance Number 8.</b> This gives
you a strong power of speech and you should do your
best to get into something of that order, if your other
numbers do not show too adverse an influence.</p>

<p>You can begin in a small way, before small groups,
watching for criticisms and comments and governing
yourself accordingly. But do NOT desire mere flattery.
The way to stop people flattering you is to make
them tell you just WHY your work is good. Study the
speaking ability of famous people and read important
literature.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p084_u" id="anch_p084_u">u</a>&mdash;Warning to Number 8.</b> Do not talk too much.
Keep your plans, your ambitions to yourself. It is by
exposing your plans thru the desire for praise or approval
that you dissipate your "steam" or energy to
execute those plans. "Plan your work, then WORK
your plan," but do not tell your plan.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="sidenote">SEVEN PRINCIPLES--ANIMAL PLANE</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><b>The Application of the Seven Principles to the Animal
Plane</b></p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p085_v" id="anch_p085_v">v</a>&mdash;</b>FORCE, the First Principle, when applied to
the ANIMAL PLANE of Life, results in the taking up
of new exercises that you may wish to follow; it results
in the use of your body in appearance or in muscle as a
form of persuasion to get things done. This leads to
POWER in what is called Animal Magnetism.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p085_w" id="anch_p085_w">w</a>&mdash;</b>CHOICE, the Second Principle, when applied
to the ANIMAL PLANE of Life, results in the right
selection of foods, clothes, house and sex. It gives the
ability to select the right mate. This application leads
to RICHES of a physical nature, the possession of property
and goods in the line of the CHOICE that may be
made.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p085_x" id="anch_p085_x">x</a>&mdash;</b>ORDER, the Third Principle, when applied
to the ANIMAL PLANE, enables one to place the right
action in the right time and place. It leads to the tactful
handling of the body and the faculties. It makes
for nice foods, well served; for nice homes, well appointed;
for a careful mate of real fitness to your life
and environment. This application leads to WISDOM
as to the right time, place and use of all physical things.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p085_y" id="anch_p085_y">y</a>&mdash;</b>COHESION, the Fourth Principle, when applied
to the ANIMAL PLANE, helps to hold the home
together; makes you attractive to business partners and
associates; makes people want to work with you and
for you. It leads to STRENGTH of your body and your
physical collections of things and possessions. When
you develop the COHESION in your ANIMAL PLANE
you give the appearance of being well-built and well
able to take care of yourself.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p085_z" id="anch_p085_z">z</a>&mdash;</b>DISCARD, the Fifth Principle, when applied
to the ANIMAL PLANE, enables you to cast off undesirable
foods, undesirable clothes and living quarters
and even an undesirable person, though they may claim
the ties of relationship. In fact the casting off of undesirable
relatives is the hardest test of this Principle
of DISCARD. This Principle is also much needed in
changing one's life from an undesirable or low tendency
to a higher one. DISCARD is a constant but
little understood Principle in Life. It is the hardest
to understand and to operate of any of them. Quite
generally we do not know when we need it on the ANIMAL
PLANE, because of our love of ease and our
aversion to change. We feel, usually, that what has
been good enough up to now, should be good enough
further on. We come to HONOR when we know and
use the Fifth Principle, DISCARD.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p086_a" id="anch_p086_a">a</a>&mdash;</b>TRANSMUTATION, the Sixth Principle,
when applied to the ANIMAL PLANE, helps you to
make the unlovely into the lovely. It transmutes food
into muscle and brain; a house into a home; a woman
into a wife or sweetheart; a man into a husband or
lover. This application causes the ANIMAL PLANE
part of the human life to arise toward the MIND
PLANE, the next logical step. The right use of the
Principle of TRANSMUTATION, without suppression,
is the only answer to the sex question. Any right application
of TRANSMUTATION leads to GLORY.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p086_b" id="anch_p086_b">b</a>&mdash;</b>SPIRITUALITY, the Seventh Principle, can
be only indirectly applied to the ANIMAL PLANE
through the MIND PLANE. This will be explained in
the next lesson, after the Number 9 (page 94, paragraph
g).</p>

It gives you a disposition that is ardent, active,
positive, impulsive and impetuous. You are a
lover of freedom and independence, and cannot endure
restraint, confinement or delay. You are generous
and frank, an admirer of openness, bravery and
courage, both physical and moral. You have much
self-confidence, and are usually able to hold your own
easily, being prompt in word and action. You need to
beware of being too rash and headstrong, for you are
rather inclined to be aggressive and self-willed; and
you are likely to bring many troubles upon yourself
through this. You have a good deal of pride, which is
easily wounded, and you do not find it easy to remain
cool and self-restrained under provocation. You are
an active and energetic worker and can accomplish
much in a short time, and you have it in you to become
very practical and capable in the world if you exercise
a little self-discipline.</p>

up, having good generative force, which if conserved,
protects you from ill health. Scorpio <img alt="scorpio" src="images/scorpio.gif" /> is a
vital sign, and governs the excretory system. The influence
of the stars, point to a long journey, which you
will be called to take later on in life; it will be made
necessary by your position and business connections.
You will not travel by water, and during this trip you
will hear of the death of a near relative; you will meet
with success and make many friends, one of whom will
prove treacherous, and will not hesitate to slander you,
trying to ruin your prosperity in business and love. Yet
the ensuing year offers you a very fortunate period,
and there will be many advantages to gain.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p088_k" id="anch_p088_k">k</a>&mdash;</b>You are attracted strongly to the opposite
Sex, either in friendship or association, of some sort,
or in marriage, and then you are very devoted to your
selected partner, and make an ardent and enthusiastic
lover, as you are eager and somewhat passionate in
your attachments. Your marriage partner will probably
be of a martial type, positive, active and rather
masterful, and will be one who desires to hold the reins
and rule the roost. Much depends upon your conditions,
surroundings and environments, as to how you
will enjoy and appreciate life, for you have acute perceptions
and sense things in a peculiar manner, through
your feelings. You are mediumistic and very often are
impressed with feelings and thoughts that come from
others, either on this or the other side of the grave.
You must live purely, to be happy.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p089_n" id="anch_p089_n">n</a>&mdash;</b>The Eighth House, has a direct bearing upon
death and all matters connected therewith, such as the
goods of the dead, legacies, occupations connected with
death. Now if it happens that evil aspects of the ponderous
planets are coinciding with the passage through
this house, it is most probable that deaths may occur
in your social circle, or deaths will in some way effect
you, or come in possession of goods left by death. The
influence is a very pronounced and decided one, and its
effect will be to awaken the latent possibilities of you
at this time. You will be more determined and will
become very firm in decisions and may through a fixity
of purpose carry ambitions to a successful issue; but
there is a dangerous side to the passage through this
house. For with the feeling of firmness that accompany
it you will gain some knowledge of inherent
power, and will arouse now any pride or dignity that
may be latent in your nature. Feelings of jealousy
will also be experienced which will incline to caustic
utterances and sarcasm, when vexed or offended, for
the gentler side of the nature will be overlaid by this
apparently coarser vibration but it is the awakening of
the real potency of the nature that will give rise to
this change.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p089_nn" id="anch_p089_nn">nn</a>&mdash;</b>This period is also not so good for the health
of some who become here susceptible to feverish and
inflammatory conditions and also likely to act more
from impulse than from careful thought. You cannot
be too discreet with regard to the opposite sex, and all
actions should be thought out beforehand, as the result
of any rash conduct at this time will be likely to cause
you much sorrow and trouble in the future. Hence
you must avoid all rash and hasty tendencies and
eschew disputes and quarrels, for the least excitement
is apt to arouse the passional nature to its fullest expression.
But much of course depends upon the Horoscope
at birth as to what aspects are formed by direction
for the year inquired of.</p>

word Love has the same value
(18-9) and Love is the final

The color of the Law

living sacrifice that Love gladly gives in
its demonstrations.</p>

your name means a self-centered nature, but kindly.
Likely to attract the help of others also. The letter R
means rapidity and roaming with a tendency to
raciness or occasional daring and recklessness. The

have chosen the "way of the triple crown," which may
mean triple sorrows or it may mean triple portions of
joy, according to the way you USE your numbers and
your astrological conditions. It is probably your last
incarnation on the earth plane, if you can so apply
yourself unto wisdom that this indeed may be the last.
Otherwise you may need to do it over.</p>

As 9 is a disappearing yet ever present number when
added to anything else (as 9 and 5 make 14, 1 and 4
make 5 and the 9 has vanished), so your own personality
gives you certain peculiarities of seemingly vanishing
from the minds of people and yet being called
upon again and again for their needs. Your personality
expresses brotherhood, generosity, artistic expressions
of all kinds, writing, teachings and public
speaking.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p092_w" id="anch_p092_w">w</a>&mdash;9 as a Predominant Name Number</b> shows

others and others' opinions that will prove hurtful to
yourself and that will attract to you persons that you
will find very undesirable and hard to get rid of afterward.
This place of the 9, in the Predominant Name
Number, also inclines you strongly to attract dramatic

be mutually to your advantage and theirs.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p092_x" id="anch_p092_x">x</a>&mdash;9 as a Destiny Number</b> shows that you are

creative effort, sculpture, public speaking and the ministry.
It is likely that your destiny will be to struggle
along for a long while before being noticed and then

your own worst enemy. Be practical in your
morals as well as your business. Others are fully as
good as yourself and just as likely to be straight and
honest, so avoid jealously, envy, covetousness and lust
as you would the plague. Keep busy HELPING others

<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="sidenote">SEVEN PRINCIPLES--MIND PLANE</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><b>Application of the Seven Principles<br />
  to the Mind Plane</b></p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p093_a" id="anch_p093_a">a</a>&mdash;</b>FORCE, the First Principle, when applied to
the MIND PLANE of Life, shows itself in the strong
will, the stubborn Mind. It enables you to take up new
habits of thought. This application causes others to
listen to your opinions and even to seek those opinions.
It will draw the opposite sex to you, where that person
is of the intellectual type. Rightly exerted it leads to
POWER among your friends and associates. This
POWER will be limited only by your knowledge of the
reactions that you will arouse through its use.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p093_b" id="anch_p093_b">b</a>&mdash;</b>CHOICE, the Second Principle, when applied
to the MIND PLANE of Life, enables you to choose the
best reading matter; the proper teachers for your education;
the things you will accept in matters of opinion
in religion, art, science or politics. This application
gives you what is called good taste. It leads to RICHES
of knowledge and intellect.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p093_c" id="anch_p093_c">c</a>&mdash;</b>ORDER, the Third Principle, when applied
to the MIND PLANE of Life, makes you logical and direct.
It gives you good concentration, because it keeps
you in ORDER in your thoughts and brings you WISDOM
in the minds of your friends. This application
makes a channel into your own mind of all the best
thoughts that have been or will be along the line to
which you are applying yourself. ORDER attracts big
minds to you, because you and your proposition seems
logical to them. ORDER gives you better expressive
WISDOM, as to time, place and conditions to present
your ideas.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p093_d" id="anch_p093_d">d</a>&mdash;</b>COHESION, the Fourth Principle, when applied
to the MIND PLANE of Life, makes you more
continuous in your application to your beliefs and decisions.
It gives you STRENGTH of mind and power
to make others want to be in your good graces, to do
largely as you do. In fact, you may know fairly well
how much of COHESION you are exerting on the
Mind Plane by the ease with which you hold friendships
and the manner in which you are referred to in
matters of opinion. With this application strong you
will find that you exert a good influence over many and
become a tower of strength to a large number of
friends.</p>
<!-- Page 93} -->
<!-- {Page 94 -->
<p><a name="anch_p094_1" id="anch_p094_1"></a></p>
<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p094_e" id="anch_p094_e">e</a>&mdash;</b>DISCARD, the Fifth Principle, when applied
to the MIND PLANE of Life, helps you to set aside
"every weight which doth so easily beset you." (Heb.
12:1). It enables you to refuse the opinions of others,
if you wish to. This application makes you somewhat
independent in mind and is often the chief Principle
needed to put you up among the leaders in your group.
When it is known that you can refuse opinions, in the
right time and place, it is generally assumed that you
are strong minded. The mediocre mass accepts all
opinions and authority, but the outstanding person is
the one who questions thoughts, who "proves all
things and holds fast that which is good." (1 Thess.
5:21.) To DISCARD the low or the lesser, leads to
HONOR.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p094_f" id="anch_p094_f">f</a>&mdash;</b>TRANSMUTATION, the Sixth Principle,
when applied to the MIND PLANE, enables you to use
your mind in higher lines and more intellectually than
before. Your whole life becomes "transformed by the
renewing of your mind." (Romans 12:1 and 2.) The
TRANSMUTATION Principle applied to the Mind,
brings GLORY in its right use to all the other faculties
and thus the whole Life.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p094_g" id="anch_p094_g">g</a>&mdash;</b>SPIRITUALITY, the Seventh Principle, when
applied to the MIND PLANE, causes you to look into
the religious and the moral side of things. It makes
you want to be sure as to the rightness of anything before
agreeing with it. SPIRITUALITY naturally follows
TRANSMUTATION. This application of the
Principle of SPIRITUALITY must have its outlet in
every life, whether it be in the line of religion, ethics or
morals. You must not suppress entirely this part of
your nature. Let all parts of your mind grow. Thus by
applying SPIRITUALITY you will attain the inner
BLESSING.</p>

bad. Your mind is versatile and easy going, but
quick to anger, yet quicker to quiet down. You are
liberal and impartial in your opinions, but with a gift

occupations, will be of two different kinds, interfering
greatly with each other, and thus hindering your progress.

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p096_nn" id="anch_p096_nn">nn</a>&mdash;</b>You should have good business judgment,
and are rather saving with your money--perhaps too
much so, at times. Learn to be a little more open-handed.
You will be better liked, more popular even
in your own home. Not that you stint them in anything--it
is just that you never think of taking home
any little "surprises." It is rare to find anyone born
on this day, who lacks money; you are never completely
out of it, though you may never get rich. You are
artistic, and musical, and should excel as a performer,
if you ever took up the study of music seriously. You
are inclined to worry a little too seriously. You are
inclined also to get moody. You should learn that
worry has never yet prevented anything bad from happening,
but oft times throws an atmosphere around
yourself that prevents you from believing anything
worth while.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p096_p" id="anch_p096_p">p</a>&mdash;</b>This sign indicates that everything in life is a
pretty even struggle between good and bad, and that
every action brings in its wake a reaction, thus forcing
you to be most cautious in your thoughts and undertakings.
Jupiter <img alt="jupiter" src="images/jupiter.gif" />, which will be your guiding Planet

qualities, gives you a virtuous and honorable nature.
You represent the Archer, whose aim is sure, and who

are remarkably sure and keen, but too close application
to your work, is your besetting sin, so do not be so
reckless with your health, but remember that there is
a reckoning day and nature's books are justly kept.
You are probably emotional, and long for passionate
love, which you feel you could return fully if it were
given you. You have a great idea of duty and honor,
and are unflinching in devotion to them. You do not
understand the opposite sex and their ways, which are
a sealed book to you. Cultivate the gentler side of
your nature, and you will be more popular.</p>

Spirit focusing through the planet
Jupiter <img alt="jupiter" src="images/jupiter.gif" />, the planet of business, generosity
and wisdom. This brings out the advantages
of religion and deeper thought
and philosophy. Shows that these years
will bring occult tendencies to you and a
desire to know more about the psychic; or will bring a
tendency to reform and become religious. Good time
for affection and fellowship. Affects the following
years: 5th, 17th, 29th, 41st, 53rd, 77th, 89th.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p097_s" id="anch_p097_s">s</a>&mdash;</b>The Ninth House is the house of Philosophy,
and hence of all that concern the scientific and religious
attitude, and also the safety and success of long
distant voyages; also all affairs that relate to kindred
and relatives. The passage through this house will not
fail to bring some improvement in your general affairs
and bring about a favorable issue to all undertakings
at hand with proper care. The vibrations now operating
will cause you to take a more philosophical view of
life, and will tend to look upon all things from a more
hopeful standpoint than heretofore.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p097_t" id="anch_p097_t">t</a>&mdash;</b>A rather fortunate period is at hand which
tends to improve your whole conditions, also causing
the mind to take interest in all matters connected with
either the occult life, or philosophy and religion, and
if the mind of you can aspire, you will gain knowledge
wherein all things are known. By awakening the intellectual
side of the nature you will be greatly benefited
by the passage through this house. But when
living more in the material and physical plane of life
than the mental, it will give a deep interest in sports
of all kinds, outdoor exercise, walking, driving, boating,
gambling, etc.</p>

<p>Generally this influence will bring a rebellious
spirit and a disregard for established law and order
with a tendency to be indifferent and in consequence
thereof may suffer through the aforesaid mentioned,
not only in pocket or health, but also by scandal and
loss of reputation.</p>

<b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p099_u" id="anch_p099_u">u</a>&mdash;THE UNA LUMA.</b>
(Circle or cipher, containing
the Eye of Aum and the
4, in the Chart of the Lumanus.)
This is the Nothingness
that includes all things,
and so it has no word or
letter values. It is the
Una Luma or womb of the
Universe, through which must come all
Life and all the joining of soul and body
of animate life.</p>

<p style="clear:both;"><span style="float:left;">
<img src="images/img_002.jpg" style="width:100px; height:348px; border-width:0px;" title="Chart of the Lumanus" alt="Chart of the Lumanus" /></span></p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p099_v" id="anch_p099_v">v</a>&mdash;</b>It is the concealed circle or
cipher, not at first noticeable on the
Lumanus, containing the Eye of Aum and
the 4, thus representing the concealed and
hidden beginnings of life. The Una
Luma is that nothing, which, when added
to anything else will multiply it by ten (as
the 1 beside the 0 makes 10). Thus the
body or temple of Man (1) coming thru
the Una Luma, or Nothingness, becomes
the 10 or Man beside God.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p099_w" id="anch_p099_w">w</a>&mdash;</b>The colors of the Una Luma are
Blue in its upper half, for Spiritual Truth
and Green in the lower half for earthly
growth and gain. It is thus divided into
an upper or Spiritual use and a lower or
material use. The life force in the body
may also be seen in a Spiritual way or in the grosser
physical way, used for the Godly ideals or for the physical
gratification.</p>


<p class="konubas" style="clear:both;">LOVE AND LAW</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p099_x" id="anch_p099_x">x</a>&mdash;</b>When the Una Luma circle is combined with
the cross containing all the figures from 5 to 9, thus
including all the symbols
from the Eye of Aum to
the 9, we have the symbol
for Venus <img alt="venus" src="images/venus.gif" />, in astrology,
the planet of Love, Art
and Woman.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p100_y" id="anch_p100_y">y</a>&mdash;</b>Then all your
world is balanced by the
power of Love and all is
well in your life. The
Soul is at the top, at its
best, and the world is secondary
to the inner worship of the Most High.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p100_z" id="anch_p100_z">z</a>&mdash;</b>But sometimes we make the LAW first in our
minds (the 9 space) and get it at the TOP of life (see
Mars) so that the Soul is at the bottom and the
Law at the top. This is
seen in some religions and
in marriages where force
is used to continue the relationships.</p>

have the Cross on TOP of
the mountain and have
made our Calvary. It is
the symbol of Mars <img alt="mars" src="images/mars.gif" />, the
planet of Force, Combat,
Energy and Sex. It is
usually sex and selfishness
that brings this about
and the remedy is to make the deeper SOUL emotions
FIRST in your life.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><b>Positions of the Naught 0</b></p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p100_b" id="anch_p100_b">b</a>&mdash;</b>While the cipher or naught (0) cannot appear
AS a final number in the Four Phases of Soul Path,
Personality, Predominant or Destiny Numbers, it
DOES appear IN those numbers sometimes, as in a
Number made up of 37, which adds to 10, which adds
to 1. Here we see the cipher in use and as it nearly
always appears in the second addition of the Number
wanted, as 37-10-1, it has a small influence in life.
Therefore:</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p100_c" id="anch_p100_c">c</a>&mdash;</b>0 IN a Soul Path Number shows that you intend
to apply your earth life this time to the widest
or most universal possible area. It shows a tendency
to take in too much territory, sometimes, but it makes
for fine ideals and aims.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p100_d" id="anch_p100_d">d</a>&mdash;</b>0 IN a Personality Number means that you
will have a wide view, a broad mind, and some tendency
to extended thought, although not always deep
thought. It adds generosity to your personality and
makes you more and more popular.</p>

<p>&mdash;<a name="anch_p100_e" id="anch_p100_e">e</a>&mdash;0 IN a Predominant Name Number cannot
occur.</p>

<p>&mdash;<a name="anch_p100_f" id="anch_p100_f">f</a>&mdash;0 IN a Destiny Number shows that you will
make your great mark in the world through your widespread
and universal applications of ideas. These may
be old ideas, but they will be in a new style or garb.
You will have the chance to become famous through
this tendency.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p100_ff" id="anch_p100_ff">ff</a>&mdash;</b>0 IN a Public Appearance Number shows
that it would be fairly easy for you to gather crowds
or to select the managers who could get them for you.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="sidenote">APPLICATION--SEVEN PRINCIPLES</span></p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p101_g" id="anch_p101_g">g</a>&mdash;</b>WARNING. Do not use ANY number to
LEAN on. Do your stuff. Be yourself, regardless of
how the numbers seem to fit or misfit your hopes and
ideals. Keep your ideals anyway and go on with them,
and you will find it possible to develop the numbers
you DO like in your readings, above those you do not
like.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><b>Application of the Seven Principles to the<br />
  Monetary Plane</b></p>


<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p101_h" id="anch_p101_h">h</a>&mdash;</b>FORCE, the First Principle, when applied to
the MONETARY PLANE, enables you to make a little
money and have plenty of POWER. It makes you able
to appear prosperous. Here you begin to know the
chief law of prosperity, "To him that hath shall be
given and from him that hath not shall be taken away
even that which he hath." (Matt. 25:29.) You appear
prosperous and prosperity follows you. You
learn to spend with that certain manner that makes
you appear to have plenty. You recognize the FORCE
of money, but you are not a slave to it. You may know
that you are developing the FORCE you need on the
Monetary Plane, when people begin to seek your opinion
on the wisdom of any purchase.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p101_j" id="anch_p101_j">j</a>&mdash;</b>CHOICE, the Second Principle, applied to the
MONETARY PLANE, causes you to choose carefully
how and where you will spend your money. This inclines
you to RICHES in money matters. You learn
here that it is not the saving of money that makes you
rich but the wise SPENDING of money in the direction
you are going, in the direction of your great objective;
this will make you rich. To do this requires a good
use of CHOICE, this Second Principle of Creation.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p101_k" id="anch_p101_k">k</a>&mdash;</b>ORDER, the Third Principle, applied to the
MONETARY PLANE, tends to put all expenditures
and receipts in ORDER. It makes good bookkeepers
and accountants. Sometimes this application may enlarge
caution and fear. ORDER may be carried too
far, even on the Monetary Plane and cause one to be
too exact and mercenary and too much bound to a plan.
The right use of ORDER, however, in money matters,
will lead to WISDOM in both spending and accounting
money.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p101_l" id="anch_p101_l">l</a>&mdash;</b>COHESION, the Fourth Principle, applied to
the MONETARY PLANE, would incline you to put all
your money into one thing, to conserve your money, to
invest it very securely. It would cause your money to
readily attract more money. By this means you may
know when you are really applying COHESION to
your finances. It always gives STRENGTH to your
money matters to be known as a conservative, careful
type of spender.</p>
<!-- Page 101} -->
<!-- {Page 102 -->
<p><a name="anch_p102_1" id="anch_p102_1"></a></p>
<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p102_m" id="anch_p102_m">m</a>&mdash;</b>DISCARD, the Fifth Principle, applied to
the MONETARY PLANE, enables you to refuse yourself
the present pleasure for the future good. It enables
you to spend your money on the thing needed
first and to DISCARD the thing you want for the thing
you need. It leads to the HONOR type of mind in you
for both spending and receiving, for you can even DISCARD
the receipt of money when you think it is not
right for you to have it. This is one of the difficult
uses of the Principle of DISCARD, but frequently the
shortest road to HONOR.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p102_n" id="anch_p102_n">n</a>&mdash;</b>TRANSMUTATION, the Sixth Principle, applied
to the MONETARY PLANE, leads you to the
benevolent and spiritual uses of your money. It will
help you to find the inner blessing through the giving
of your Tithes and offerings. TRANSMUTATION is
peculiarly applicable to this phase of money matters,
for the giving of the Tithe or Tenth of your income
to a spiritual ministry for the advancement of Truth
is directly productive of the deepest inner blessing.
At the Head Office of the Enumeration we have some
amazing testimonials of the sudden increases and other
blessings that followed the giving of the Tithe. The
blessing to the world largely comes from the fact that
the Tithes sent in are used for the publication work of
the Enumeration. Thus it is not only the giver who is
blessed, but thousands of others. In this way money
reaches GLORY.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p102_o" id="anch_p102_o">o</a>&mdash;</b>SPIRITUALITY, the Seventh Principle, applied
to the MONETARY PLANE, gives you a new perception
of money. It brings you a new idea of the
great Source of all wealth, the Lord within you. It
leads you to know that spiritual peace can also be
caused by the possession of prosperity. It brings the
BLESSING of money in a deeper sense.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p103_r" id="anch_p103_r">r</a>&mdash;</b>Saturn <img alt="saturn" src="images/saturn.gif" /> tends to give you a disposition that
is sober, serious and thoughtful. It is the planet that
naturally rules old age, and its best influence is not

reserve and restraint, as well as some natural
inclination to frugality, prudence and cautiousness.
You should also gain from it strength of will and a
patient, persevering disposition, with calmness, fortitude
and serenity. You may at times be a little lacking
in buoyancy and cheerfulness, and you do not unbend
socially as easily as some persons can, or produce so
much mirth, fun and jollity, although you can appreciate
these when they come your way. You have a
good deal of practical ability and can manage things
and persons ably and economically. You are ambitious
and can form far-reaching plans and schemes and
spend a long time in carrying them out. The best lesson
that Saturn <img alt="saturn" src="images/saturn.gif" /> teaches is self-control, prudence,
patience, chastity, thrift and the meditative mind, as

deceived by outside appearances. You will spend
money freely for personal gratification, but in all outlays
you have a keen eye for bargains; in whatever line

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p105_v" id="anch_p105_v">v</a>&mdash;</b>Your life is pretty certain to be a continual
fight against worldly tendencies unless you choose to
patch up a truce with them, and let them have the rule
and sway, which you are not always willing to do.
You have a good deal of self-control, but are apt to fly
into unreasonable tempers at times. Tuesdays and
Saturdays should be good days for you to begin any
important undertakings. You are inclined to be delicate
and should take good care of your health, particularly
your lungs, which are inclined to be weak. Live
out of doors as much as possible and practice deep
breathing exercises. You are rather optimistic, and inclined
to look on the bright diverting side of things.
You are of a sociable nature and naturally crave company.
You are always at your best under these conditions.
Hence, you should not live in the country, which
is not suited to your temperament. You are fond of
intellectual pursuits and studies, but remember, that
love and duty are higher human attributes than intellect,
and that these are the most important in the long
run. You have great natural abilities and powers,
which if your health permits, and you determine to
exercise, should bring you into prominence. You have
great determination. You will be disappointed in love,
when young, but later in life you will regain faith in
human nature, and will marry happily beyond your expectations.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p105_w" id="anch_p105_w">w</a>&mdash;</b>During the day, you are bright and active,
but restless at night; this is more noticeable while the

find diversion and excitement in different forms; you
always insist upon being treated with respect, and the
surest way to win your esteem, is to pay court to your

Relates to honors and dignities that may
come to you during these years, but are
likely to be more of honors than money or
profit to you. These will be honors that
will be according to the education and the
preparation that you have made, or how near ready
you are, in other words, for these honors. May get
news of your mother, or, if she is passed on, may get
word from her on the other side. Affects the following

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p106_z" id="anch_p106_z">z</a>&mdash;</b>The Tenth House being the most elevated
part of the heavens, is the house of honor, reputation,
profession and worldly position. Therefore, it certainly
will bring out all the moral tendencies, for this house
has much to do with an elevation to a better position in
life, always giving advantages for progress, and makes
you endeavor to improve surroundings, and thus making
this year a good time of raising yourself into a
higher phase of efficiency and service. All matters of
a business nature will now come to the fore, and everything
connected with work in which you are interested
will tend to become prominent in this year, so that
many advantages may be gained at this time. It also
has something to do with the domestic arrangements,
affecting the maternal side of the home and bringing
much activity therein, either on account of a possible
marriage or family mourning.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p106_a" id="anch_p106_a">a</a>&mdash;</b>You will now be more ambitious than ever
and if progressive enough to take full advantage of
this period or, according to inherited ability, to fully
respond to this new beneficial influence, you are sure
to gain advancement and rise to a better position than
before. You will become more industrious and persevering
and, with endurance and tact, may now make
great headway. If you wish to improve your conditions,
now is the time. Your stars will assist you to
obtain a footing which will make the whole of the
future.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="sidenote">THE NUMBER 11</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><b>(See also Number 2, Lesson 2)</b></p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p109_b" id="anch_p109_b">b</a>&mdash;</b>11, being two 1's, is a seeming paradox. 1 is
a positive number, but adding the 1 and 1 gives us 2,
which is a negative or receptive number.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p109_c" id="anch_p109_c">c</a>&mdash;</b>11 has long been considered by numerologists
a master number. It is amusing, sometimes, to see the
unlearned numerologist raise his eyebrows in apparent
astonishment, because one may have an 11 in his name.
What he does not see is that a great majority of people
who have the number 11 in their name or birthdate,
are not using it as 11 at all, but as its value, 2, which
is vastly different.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p109_d" id="anch_p109_d">d</a>&mdash;</b>This leads to the question as to when the 11
should be reduced to its sum of 2 and when it should
not be. When you are dealing with a very spiritual
subject or person, in whom the 11 is evident by the full
addition of name or birthdate or of a word, THEN you
may leave the 11 and call it a master indication.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p109_e" id="anch_p109_e">e</a>&mdash;</b>For example, the word Jesus has a value of
11 and should be left that way, that is, as 11. So with
the words Lord Jesus Christ, together, make 11, as well
as the words Creative Christ Consciousness, making 11.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p109_f" id="anch_p109_f">f</a>&mdash;</b>In all these cases to get their value they may
be left as 11. But to prove the position of the Christ
as the Son of God, in the SECOND personality in the
God Head, any of the above titles may then be reduced
to their sum, which is 2.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p109_g" id="anch_p109_g">g</a>&mdash;</b>Unless you know a person to be a master or
very highly developed in a spiritual way, you are usually
safe in reducing the 11 to 2, for that type of person
has either attained the heights that make him or her
very obviously a master, or else has reduced the splendid
11 to its digit 2, in his life and actions and is consequently
a common or mediocre type, quite frequently.
All indications point at least to a secondary position
in life for a number 2 person, though they may possibly
get to the position of chief attorney, chief adjuster, ambassador,
or become a great minister for some special
thing or some great country or people. This they would
do by working upward through their obstacles and restrictions
to the top of the SECOND place, the idealized
number 2. The 11 disciples watched Jesus (11)
ascend. His life had been SECOND in the minds of
His generation, but after He ascended to become SECOND
on the throne with the Father-Mother God (1)
He became FIRST on earth.</p>

<!-- {Page 110 -->
<p><a name="anch_p110_1" id="anch_p110_1"></a></p>
<p><b>&mdash;h&mdash;</b>Still you should keep in mind that all these
things are INFLUENCES only, not fates, and that other
numbers may be strong enough to offset the 2 in your
case.</p>

<p class="konubas">POSITIONS OF THE NUMBER 11</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><b>(See also the Number 2, Lesson 2)</b></p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p110_j" id="anch_p110_j">j</a>&mdash;</b>In cases where you feel reasonably sure, from
observation of the life and of your other numbers and
indications of astral and other characteristics, that the
person really IS living the life of the 11, a master life,
then you may use the following definitions of positions
to apply. Remember, that "by their fruits shall ye
know them." (Matt. 7:16.)</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p110_k" id="anch_p110_k">k</a>&mdash;11 as a Soul Path Number&mdash;</b>This would indicate
that you chose a path of deep idealism in the
lines of religion and philosophy. You desire to conquer
the body and its passions and may make the mistake
of being too aesthetic. It will be well for you to
avoid the total suppression of your nature as you may
get a wrong impression that total suppression means a
conquering, when it may mean a killing out of fine
qualities in you. Let your MODERATION be known to
all men, not too much nor too little. (Phil. 4:5.)</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p110_l" id="anch_p110_l">l</a>&mdash;11 as a Personality Number&mdash;</b>Here we see
that you will need to do whatever your Soul has mapped
out, in a masterly way. Nothing short of the finished
way of going about your life work will ever please
you. See to it that you do each task thoroughly, even
when it is a small one. If you would have the bigger
work your mastery deserves, do the little work so well
it will fade out of the picture. Remember that when
the 11 is reduced it makes a 2, who easily becomes the
idle dreamer, the sychophant. While 11 has a high
vibration and indicates the master mind, the 2 can be
either high or low in its vibrations, can be either a
master or a slave.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p110_m" id="anch_p110_m">m</a>&mdash;11 as a Predominant Name Number&mdash;</b>Here
the 11 means that you are likely to attract to yourself
those who are masters in their line. It shows that it
will be easy for you to attract very spiritual people
around you; that you will readily understand the depth
of their wisdom and be able in a fine way to imitate
it. You also make an excellent head for a campaign
of lectures, being very useful in assembling the public
for the finer type of spiritual teacher and lecturer.</p>

<p><a name="anch_p111_1" id="anch_p111_1"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="sidenote">SEVEN PRINCIPLES--PSYCHIC PLANE</span></p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p111_n" id="anch_p111_n">n</a>&mdash;11 as a Destiny Number&mdash;</b>This shows that the
great objective of your soul in coming to this earth
plane was to establish some new or deeper form of
ethics or religion. You are marking a soul path through
the universe that will be noted on earth for a great reform
movement in which you will not appear very much
yourself. Your great work will probably be carried
out by some great speakers who will put it before the
people. In this line be very careful also that you do
not lose all the monetary reward that should be yours.
You will need to make some very careful arrangements
and find the types of people to help you who will work
with you in the ideal side of the idea, rather than for
the monetary rewards alone.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p111_nn" id="anch_p111_nn">nn</a>&mdash;11 as a Public Appearance Number&mdash;</b>This
shows that you will best appeal to your public from the
standpoint of the mysterious and the psychic. You
should draw them to you from a religious standpoint
from what they do NOT know about you, but from
what they think concerning you.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p111_p" id="anch_p111_p">p</a>&mdash;</b>Your writings are likely to have a more far
reaching effect than your speech. This place of the
11 also shows that you will attract great ideas and
minds from the other planes out beyond this and that
you will therefore need to be cautious that your work
shall not be destroyed through ridicule before it is
strong enough to stand alone.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p111_q" id="anch_p111_q">q</a>&mdash;Warning&mdash;</b>The mere fact that you have an
11 in your name or birthdate does not make you a master,
nor give you anything to get superior over. You
must pick UP that 11, keep it from descending into
a 2 and go ON to your success. Having the qualities
of a master does you no good till you USE them. It is
what you DO with what you know that makes you
what you ARE.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><b>Application of the Seven Principles to the</b>
  <b>Psychic Plane</b></p>


<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p111_b" id="anch_p111_b">b</a>&mdash;</b>FORCE, the First Principle, applied to the
PSYCHIC PLANE, inclines you to project the Soul out
beyond the body in what are sometimes called Astral
journeys. It also enables you to cause other people to
do things when the desire of your Soul is in harmony
with the commanding ability of your sub-conscious
mind. This requires the application of FORCE to your
Psychic nature and leads to POWER with others. It
was this application of FORCE that the Christ used in
driving the money-changers from the Temple. (John
2, 14; 16.) It led them to fear His POWER. If you
will let your angry thoughts work themselves out in
imaginary conversation when you are alone, you can
direct those thoughts to the person at whom you are
angry, and the FORCE will nearly always have the
effect of making them come around to your way of
thinking, if you KNOW just what you DO want them
to DO.</p>
<!-- Page 111} -->
<!-- {Page 112 -->
<p><a name="anch_p112_1" id="anch_p112_1"></a></p>
<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p112_c" id="anch_p112_c">c</a>&mdash;</b>CHOICE, the Second Principle applied to the
PSYCHIC PLANE, will bring the companionship of
other Souls to you in the silent hours. It will help you
to have the right kind of people around you. You will
attract those you can love by making a CHOICE of the
kind you want, while you are in the quiet times of your
meditations. You can make a CHOICE of the things
you want, you can acquire RICHES if you only will devote
your sub-conscious or soul mind to what you
WANT, instead of worrying as to why you do not attain.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p112_d" id="anch_p112_d">d</a>&mdash;</b>ORDER, the Third Principle, applied to the
PSYCHIC PLANE, will help you have the right time
and the right place for your meditations and for your
other Psychic labors and efforts. You will avoid "casting
your pearls before swine," (Matt. 7; 6) because
you will tell your deeper experiences and emotions only
in the proper ORDER, that is, to those who will understand.
You will thus use WISDOM in the gaining of
your psychic experiences and in their telling.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p112_e" id="anch_p112_e">e</a>&mdash;</b>COHESION, the Fourth Principal, applied to
the PSYCHIC PLANE, helps you to hold on and be firm
in your convictions and not to be "turned about by
every wind of doctrine," (Eph. 4:14.) It helps you to
know what you know and be firm about it. If you have
followed the instructions in the preceding paragraph
on Order, you will know by now the sweet peacefulness
that comes after a firm decision to stay by one thing.
Here also you gain STRENGTH in the application of
COHESION for you attract around you others who will
have experienced things of the higher nature like yourself.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p112_f" id="anch_p112_f">f</a>&mdash;</b>DISCARD, the Fifth Principle, applied to the
PSYCHIC PLANE, gives you the ability to "try the
spirits, whether they are of God," (1 John 4:1.) It
gives you the gift of "discerning spirits," oftentimes to
a great degree. (1 Cor. 12:10.) You may know that
you are exercising DISCARD on the Psychic Plane
when your sleep is untroubled, yet pervaded by a sense
of closeness of the Lord in your Soul; when you seem
able to send gloomy thoughts away at will. Then you
have DISCARDED the undesirable on the Psychic
Plane. You have come over into the sunshine and
away from the shadows.</p>

<p><a name="anch_p113_1" id="anch_p113_1"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="sidenote">PSYCHIC PLANE</span></p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p113_g" id="anch_p113_g">g</a>&mdash;</b>TRANSMUTATION, the Sixth Principle, applied
to the PSYCHIC PLANE, leads you to see the
beautiful beyond. Sometimes this develops so far that
you cannot express it. Then you learn to apply the
other principles previous to this one, from the force of
being misunderstood. When you make this application
you voluntarily shut yourself out from much of the
world, you cease to care for many of the common
things you once loved. This is the true and deliberate
conversion, the real conversion, for it does not depend
on the emotions of some great preacher or evangelist,
but takes place silently, quietly, but quickly within
yourself, when you apply TRANSMUTATION to your
Psychic nature and partake of the GLORY that is
yours.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p113_h" id="anch_p113_h">h</a>&mdash;</b>Now you come to the first of the REAL
BLESSINGS, the BLESSING that comes from the application
of SPIRITUALITY to THE PSYCHIC PLANE.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p113_j" id="anch_p113_j">j</a>&mdash;</b>SPIRITUALITY, the Seventh Principle, applied
to the PSYCHIC PLANE, leads you into a dream
state of blissful contemplation. It is a state to be attained
only after you have applied all seven of the
Principles to all four of the Planes up to this point.
Now you begin to see the plan of all things, now your
life has advanced till you are almost beyond the earthly.
You may even be called "super-human" by some
from your powers of discernment. Your observation
will be amazing, your memory prodigious.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p113_k" id="anch_p113_k">k</a>&mdash;</b>The chief way to attain this is not only thru
meditations and many ventures into the Silences; it is
also by the way of service to others who are ready to
advance a step to where YOU are. You must be a
faithful teacher to THAT one, to go on yourself, IT IS
THE TEST. You must be aloof only to those who
would oppose or spoil you. You must be HUMBLE to
the seeker. You must be humble WITHIN, yet bold
without.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p114_n" id="anch_p114_n">n</a>&mdash;</b>Saturn <img alt="saturn" src="images/saturn.gif" /> tends to give you a disposition that
is sober, serious, and thoughtful. It is the planet that
naturally rules old age, and its best influence is not
usually seen until youth is passed. It gives you self-control,
reserve and restraint, as well as some natural
inclination to frugality, prudence and cautiousness.
You should also gain from it strength of will and a patient,
persevering disposition, with calmness, fortitude
and serenity. You may at times be a little lacking in
buoyancy and cheerfulness, and you do not unbend
socially so easily as some persons can, or produce so
much mirth, fun and jollity, although you can appreciate
these when they come your way. You have a
good deal of practical ability and can manage things
and persons ably and economically. You are ambitious
and can form far-reaching plans and schemes and
spend a long time in carrying them out. The best lesson
that Saturn <img alt="saturn" src="images/saturn.gif" /> teaches is self-control, prudence, patience,
chastity, thrift and the meditative mind, as well
as to distinguish between real worth and superficial
pretentiousness.</p>

<p>Saturn <img alt="saturn" src="images/saturn.gif" /> is considered an unfortunate planet owing
to its power to limit and restrict, it therefore has a binding
and restraining influence. It is the bridge between
the emotions and the mind and governs them until self-control
is secured.</p>

<p>Uranus <img alt="uranus" src="images/uranus.gif" /> has been called the eccentric planet. Its
influence is chiefly seen in new inventions and electrical
contrivances. You have more ability along these lines,
no doubt, than you know about. This planet causes
you to love the mystic and the occult. It leads you to
great depths of thought and sometimes to sophistries
and arguments that depend entirely on cleverness for
their establishment.</p>

sign of Aquarius <img alt="aquarius" src="images/aquarius.gif" />. You are cool, cautious, in some
degree, active, restless. Generally truthful, though
you lack frankness. You have a great many difficulties
to encounter in life, but rise triumphant above all
of them. You have strong religious tendencies at
times, though the practical affairs of life make them
recede into the background of your mind and thoughts.
You are inclined to be reckless, and throw away good
opportunities, which are offered to you, simply because
of this. You like excitement and constant "go" and dislike
more than anything else to sit down and fold your
hands and do nothing. Then you complain to others
about your bad luck, when the fault is really within
yourself to a great extent. You waste your energies,
instead of conserving them and using them for a definite
purpose. You must learn the truth of the saying,
"To him that hath, shall be given; and from him that
hath not, shall be taken even that which he hath."
This is particularly true in your case. You have great
possibilities, make use of them.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p115_r" id="anch_p115_r">r</a>&mdash;</b>You have a sort of piquant good-nature, which
makes it the easiest matter in the world for you to make
voluminous promises, and still easier matter to break
them, which you do with the most charming naivete,
which might be annoying if anyone knowing you put
much confidence in your word. You do not do this
through any base motive. Your shortdoings and peccadillos
do not wear somber hues, at least not often,
but you can be very crooked and are apt to be tricky,
though not wishing for a moment to do anyone any
harm. But you are almost universally liked. You are
very generous, by spells. You are frequently original
in ideas, and you have organizing ability.</p>

Uranus <img alt="uranus" src="images/uranus.gif" />, the planet of eccentric ideas,
electrical invention, and strange business;
and the planet of deep thought, calm
strength and some mysticism and deep
psychology. These years are related to
wealth, friends, unexpected outcomes,
losses sometimes through misplaced friendships, unexpected
happenings to children, younger brothers, and
those younger persons that may be directly connected
with you. Affects the following years: 3rd, 15th, 27th,
39th, 51st, 63rd, 75th, 87th, 99th.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p116_u" id="anch_p116_u">u</a>&mdash;</b>The Eleventh House is concerned with friendship,
friends, hope, trust, expectance or desire. Therefore,
in passing through this house, such matters will
be brought forward prominently. Fresh experiences
in connection with friends and acquaintances, and
some new friendships will be formed that will play a
very important part in your life's history. Hopes,
wishes and desires will now become much stronger and
you will be inclined to acquire or deal in matters of
higher thought subjects. This will cause you to take
deeper interest in all intellectual pursuits. You will
now join groups or persons or associations, of some
kind, and will form attachments that will be idealistic
in nature or of a mental character rather than in any
way emotional or sensual. You will be much inclined
towards all things of reform and will investigate those
things which are connected with aspirations that are
mental or spiritual rather than physical or material.
Its natural tendency is to lift you up towards good
fortune, prosperity, happiness and pleasures by friends</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="sidenote">THE NUMBER 12</span></p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p119_v" id="anch_p119_v">v</a>&mdash;</b>12 is also a number of great power, especially
in the lines of rulership and authority. The word Dominion
has a value of 12.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p119_w" id="anch_p119_w">w</a>&mdash;</b>It is seen that the two figures used in making
the 12, that is the 1 and the 2, signify the Father-Mother
God (1) and the Creative Christ Consciousness
(2). In this is seen the dominion (12-3) from a spiritual
standpoint.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p119_x" id="anch_p119_x">x</a>&mdash;</b>When 12 is reduced it makes a 3. 3 is the
power of expression. The words revealing and expounding
come to 3. As a general rule 12 should be
reduced to its digit 3, unless you wish to work out the
spiritual value of the 12 exclusively.</p>

<p class="konubas">POSITIONS OF THE 12</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p119_y" id="anch_p119_y">y</a>&mdash;12 as a Soul Path Number</b>&mdash;Shows that you
chose the pathway of expression through dominion,
that you can be the leader in art or drama or literature.
In any of these you can be the head of a great new
movement, causing schools to spring up all over the
country. It is a steep grade to climb, but the 12 indicates
that you can climb it if you will persist.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p119_z" id="anch_p119_z">z</a>&mdash;12 as a Personality Number</b>&mdash;Shows that you
will make your attainments in life largely by showing
your authority in the question that may be before you.
This, of course, you can only do after you have attained
to real knowledge in that line. But this tendency of
the 12 here is to make you inclined to assume authority,
to "bluff it through" in some cases. Watch this.
It is really easier to KNOW and BE the thing you profess
and will not take any more time than the making
of excuses as to why you do not know.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p119_a" id="anch_p119_a">a</a>&mdash;12 as a Predominant Name Number</b>&mdash;Here
you will attract those around you who will be authorities
in their line. With this 12 as a Predominant Name
Number you need never be much encumbered with the
companionship of the mediocre or lowly. You can ride
with the best and be acquainted with the big public
characters, for you will naturally attract that kind.
Be prepared for this by having studied deeply along
the lines of the authorities you are to meet. When you
know in advance what great person you are going to
meet, if his line is in line with your own great ambition,
then read up heavily IN ADVANCE, then LISTEN to
him. YOU can learn faster from him by having studied
to listen TO him.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p120_b" id="anch_p120_b">b</a>&mdash;12 as a Destiny Number</b>&mdash;This shows that
you will be a great success as the national head of some
movement, more particularly an art movement, or, in
some cases a political movement. Again much study is
required, not only to attain the coveted post, but to
keep ahead of those who would deprive you of it. This
number often seems to be accompanied by jealousy
and envy on the part of others. These cannot be effective
if you keep your eye ONLY on the distant goal of
success. Jealousy and envy can only defeat you if
YOU stop to regard them, or to resent them.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p120_c" id="anch_p120_c">c</a>&mdash;12 as a Public Appearance Number</b>&mdash;This
shows you can best reach the public for your great
work through some use of the voice, possibly public
speaking. While this 12 gives you dominion over many,
it also makes you very likely to scatter your forces, by
reason of the 12 having a value of 3, when reduced to
its digit. 3 is the diffusive effect, the scattering of
forces and energies, possibly through stopping to argue
with jealous or envious opposition.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p120_d" id="anch_p120_d">d</a>&mdash;Warning</b>&mdash;Have one big objective and stay
with it. Do not be inclined to show off too much. Keep
your energies for your big job, your main appeal to
your public. Do not allow personalities or flattery to
get inside of your mind. Keep yourself clean and fine.
Believe in yourself and your work, be enthusiastic but
not boastful. Put all your energies into the thing you
are doing at all times and you will come out ahead.
But plan well and thoroughly and for years ahead what
you want to be doing.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><b>Application of the Seven Principles to the Spirit Plane</b></p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p120_e" id="anch_p120_e">e</a>&mdash;</b>THE SPIRIT PLANE is peculiar, in that very
few of the Seven Principles have any application to it.
Even where we can detect some little application, it is
but dim to us. It is for the most part "beyond the veil."
The SPIRIT PLANE is that "mystery which the angels
have desired to look into." (1 Pet. 1: 12.)</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p120_f" id="anch_p120_f">f</a>&mdash;</b>FORCE, the First Principle, cannot be applied
in any way to the SPIRIT PLANE, for FORCE is the
First Emanation of SPIRIT. Since GOD is SPIRIT
(John 4:24) it follows that He is the Forceless center
of all FORCE. FORCE being His First Expression, His
Word creates. HE does not NEED FORCE, even as an
attribute. Nor does He need any other attribute that
we could name for Him.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p120_g" id="anch_p120_g">g</a>&mdash;</b>Likewise we cannot give GOD or SPIRIT the
attribute of POWER, for that is derived from FORCE.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p121_h" id="anch_p121_h">h</a>&mdash;</b>CHOICE, the Second Principle, cannot be applied
to the SPIRIT PLANE, for SPIRIT or GOD cannot
be reduced to a CHOICE. Neither could GOD be
given RICHES, as being produced by the right use of
CHOICE.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p121_j" id="anch_p121_j">j</a>&mdash;</b>ORDER, the Third Principle, cannot be applied
to the SPIRIT PLANE, for "that which GOD
(SPIRIT) doeth is perfect, nothing can be put to it and
nothing can be taken from it." (Eccles. 3:14.) Nothing
could be arranged or put in any more perfect ORDER
than is already IN SPIRIT.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p121_k" id="anch_p121_k">k</a>&mdash;</b>COHESION, the Fourth Principle, cannot be
applied to SPIRIT, for no STRENGTH can be added to
SPIRIT.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p121_l" id="anch_p121_l">l</a>&mdash;</b>DISCARD, the Fifth Principle, cannot be added
to the SPIRIT PLANE, because there is nothing in
SPIRIT to DISCARD and therefore no HONOR to
which SPIRIT may attain. How good it would be if
men could learn that, and not be pleading with SPIRIT
to send DOWN the POWER, when the HONOR and
POWER would come OUT upon them (Acts 2:3, 4)
if they could but be "still and know that the I AM is
GOD." (Psalm 46:10.)</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p121_m" id="anch_p121_m">m</a>&mdash;</b>TRANSMUTATION, the Sixth Principle,
cannot be applied to the SPIRIT PLANE, for there is
nothing to TRANSMUTE on that Plane. All is perfect.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p121_n" id="anch_p121_n">n</a>&mdash;</b>SPIRITUALITY, the Seventh Principle, cannot
be applied to the SPIRIT PLANE for the SPIRIT
PLANE IS SPIRITUALITY and is therefore the top, the
apex, of BLESSING.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p122_q" id="anch_p122_q">q</a>&mdash;</b>Jupiter <img alt="jupiter" src="images/jupiter.gif" /> tends to give a hopeful, buoyant
and cheerful disposition which should go far towards
making you popular and gaining you many friends.
You can gain social esteem and success and will be
popular and generally liked. You are benevolent,
generous and humane, and are always ready to help
those who deserve it and to assist worthy causes. You
have a regard for law, order, and propriety and for the
rules and conventions of customs; you dislike incivility,
awkwardness, or bad taste in opinions or conduct as
much as you do ugliness or inharmony in your surroundings.
You have a reverence for beauty both in
outward form and in ideas; you like beautiful surroundings
and comfort and elegance in all things. You
have energy, enthusiasm, ardour and faithfulness. You
have a natural respect for law and religion, and you
take kindly to ritual, ceremonial, and etiquette, and
are a little too likely to be bound by formalities. You
have power to cultivate the higher faculties of the mind
in the direction of law, religion, or philosophy, if you
care to do so.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p122_r" id="anch_p122_r">r</a>&mdash;</b>Jupiter <img alt="jupiter" src="images/jupiter.gif" /> is a very favorable planet when
well placed. It governs social and general prosperity,
religion, law, benevolence and good will; and gives
some appreciation of beauty, harmony, imagination,
and ideality.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p122_s" id="anch_p122_s">s</a>&mdash;</b>The planet Neptune <img alt="neptune" src="images/neptune.gif" /> furnishes an influence
toward the spiritual, the esthetic, the ethereal. It
makes you love the poetical and beautiful. It gives
you somewhat more of a freedom in your choice of the
spiritual, however, than might be implied by the presence
of Jupiter <img alt="jupiter" src="images/jupiter.gif" />, for Jupiter <img alt="jupiter" src="images/jupiter.gif" /> is a shade dogmatic
on such things.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p122_t" id="anch_p122_t">t</a>&mdash;</b>But if Neptune <img alt="neptune" src="images/neptune.gif" /> brings spirituality, it also
brings in a vagueness, an uncertainty of expression, resulting
quite often in silence where you should have
spoken; in enduring where you should have protested,
because you would not want a dispute. This should be
watched not only for your own sake, but for those who
would impose upon you; for it is not right to give people
the impression that they can go on imposing on
others as they did upon you. It is a wrong to the very
ones who impose.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p123_v" id="anch_p123_v">v</a>&mdash;</b>The emblem of this sign is the "Fishes." It
is a Watery sign. The Sun <img alt="sun" src="images/sun.gif" /> is your guiding Planet,
but was on the edge of this sign, at your birth, hence,
you will not receive the full results of the Sun's <img alt="sun" src="images/sun.gif" /> influence.
You are fond of the beautiful things in nature
and art. Persons born on this date, under the conjunction
and conditions of the Planets, have a limpid purity
of style, and among them are to be found excellent art
critics, artists and writers, and when busily engaged,
always have an eye towards the shimmering blue
water, which is their native element. You are careful
in all your duties and their fulfillment. If you start
anything, you want to "see it through." In this case,
you are almost obstinate, and often, when the case is
lost, and seen to be so by everyone else, you continue
and hold on like a bulldog, refusing to let go.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p123_w" id="anch_p123_w">w</a>&mdash;</b>You have a rather happy nature--making
light of trials and troubles, which come to you, and in
this way earning the admiration of many who come into
contact with you. You are very much drawn to the
opposite sex and will probably have a large number of
love affairs, but none of them will prove serious, and
you may never marry. Your characteristics are faithful
devotion to duty, careful attention to business, and
loyal regard for the interests of your employer. You
do not skimp or shirk performances of duty or contract,
but rather go further and give more than expected or
asked. In social affairs, you are good-naturedly careless.
Unless there is some strong attraction of love or
friendship, you are careless of keeping your appointments.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p123_x" id="anch_p123_x">x</a>&mdash;</b>Being born under this sign, you should strive
to develop your natural trust in an infinite power. This
will prevent you from crossing the bridge before it is
built, and from the many imaginary things that worry
you. You are far above the average person with your
gift of intuition and it seldom fails you; you have a
weak side to your nature, which it is hard to delineate;
perhaps you yourself do not know. You are quite affectionate,
and demand a good deal of this devotion in
return from the object of your adoration. You probably
have symbolic dreams, which you should take
some pains to have interpreted by an expert. Pay particular
attention to any warnings given you in this way.
You might make a brilliant success, if you ever decide
to go before the footlights. Your natural ability as a
mimic and being a good entertainer would have a tendency
to push you ahead to the front ranks. You like
lots of attention, but are by no means a flirt, at least
you won't acknowledge the fact. You can love very
deeply. Take care in your choice of a life partner,
for one of your nature can get in easily, but it is like
pulling teeth to get out. "Be careful."</p>

law, legal entanglements, treachery from
trusted friends and long journeys without purpose. Do
not take any long journeys, get married, or make any
new agreements for business. Poverty, exile and uncalled
for hatred can be a strong influence in these
years, unless you have already established yourself in
a good way among many thru your extra kindnesses.
Affects the following years: 2nd, 14th, 26th, 38th, 50th,
62nd, 74th, 86th, 98th.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p124_a" id="anch_p124_a">a</a>&mdash;</b>The Twelfth House being the house of tribulations,
persecution, malice, secret enemies and treason,
the passage through this house is, therefore, uncertain
in its operation, and tends to produce experiences
of a sorrowful nature, which will make it possible that
you may suffer from treachery from the hidden enmity
of supposed friends. Experiences will be had that are
far from pleasant. You will come in contact with persons
whose influence will not be beneficial.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="sidenote">TWELFTH HOUSE</span></p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p125_b" id="anch_p125_b">b</a>&mdash;</b>Domestic troubles will awaken the feelings
and so cause you to worry and have troubles which are
difficult to overcome, and it is more over now to be experienced
and many strange events effecting the emotional
side of nature will take place. It is not a good
period on the whole, but some advantages will be gained
in connection with psychic affairs. There will be
danger of becoming somewhat jealous and resentful
and one should, therefore, endeavor to keep the lower
nature well under control.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p125_c" id="anch_p125_c">c</a>&mdash;</b>As the year will prove a trying time all
around, one should do all he can to avoid giving
way to any evil tendencies. The starry-courses now
in operation will cause you to be easily influenced by
others, and hence as easily effected by degraded and
impure conditions and surroundings as by the highest
and most spiritual psychic influences. A slack time in
business is also denoted. This will cause you to be
easily inclined to fret and worry; but this is wrong, as
it will react upon the health.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p125_d" id="anch_p125_d">d</a>&mdash;</b>But in general it should be remembered that
the influences are such that nothing can come to one
that is not his own, and therefore, if you made no enemies
in the past then there is nothing to fear during
this year.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="sidenote">THE NUMBER 22</span></p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p127_e" id="anch_p127_e">e</a>&mdash;</b>22 indicates a master on the higher planes
also, as does 11. The main difference being in degree,
the 22 being the greater. The words Lord, Master and
Mind, each have a value of 22.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p127_f" id="anch_p127_f">f</a>&mdash;</b>Like the 11 and the 12, we leave the number
whole without reducing it, only when we are delineating
a deep spiritual subject. In all ordinary cases and
for worldly uses we reduce the number of the 22 to 4
by adding the 2 and the 2 of the 22.</p>


<p class="konubas">POSITIONS OF THE 22</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p127_g" id="anch_p127_g">g</a>&mdash;22 as a Soul Path Number</b>&mdash;This indicates a
pathway of mastery in the highest degree, or the common
desire to be wealthy and own property in a large
way. When one's mind goes to property, rather than
the spiritual; when you plainly feel, in your innermost
heart, that wealth is more valuable than spiritual
things, there is no reason for leaving the 22 as a sign
of mastery. The 22 should be at once reduced to 4.
Like the number 22 itself, its presence in your life is
only assured by the USE you make of it. That high use
is mastery of self and all your conditions.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p127_h" id="anch_p127_h">h</a>&mdash;22 as a Personality Number</b>&mdash;This shows that
you can make your highest success only when your aim
is on the high lines, that is, on spiritual subjects. This
position of the 22 gives you the ability to make others
want to put you in high places in anything spiritual.
If you deserve the 22 you will soon prove it by the way
you are asked to DO things, whether big or little. If
you are a master deserving of the 22 you will be asked
IF things can be done by the powers you will have
brought to the questioner's attention. If you are NOT
a master, deserving of the 22 you bear, you will be asked
to DO things; you will be reproved for dreaminess
and mooning about. Masters are always respected.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p127_j" id="anch_p127_j">j</a>&mdash;22 as a Predominant Name Number</b>&mdash;Will
show an attraction for real masters in you. You will
naturally attract the masters among the teachers without
currying their favor. Oftentimes there will come
into your life those who will speak of strange and peculiar
things. Sometimes these will be things you partly
understand, sometimes they will be things beyond you,
but if you deserve the 22 in this position you will know
the value of what you hear even when not quite able
to decipher its depth.</p>
<!-- Page 127} -->
<!-- {Page 128 -->
<p><a name="anch_p128_1" id="anch_p128_1"></a></p>
<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p128_k" id="anch_p128_k">k</a>&mdash;22 as a Destiny Number</b>&mdash;Shows that your
great objective in coming to this earth plane was to
lead others to mastership. This may mean a lifetime
of preparation for a few short years of work as in the
case of the Lord (22) and Master (22) and Jesus (2).
The world might even misjudge your work and its
meaning, but the masters that you raise from the
depths will know and the masters you serve on another
plane while still here will also know.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p128_kk" id="anch_p128_kk">kk</a>&mdash;22 as a Public Appearance Number.</b> When
the values of the initials added together make 22, it
indicates an ability to come before the public in a masterly
vibration, as an organizer. The admiration and
applause of the crowd may take the form of many gifts
and the money almost too easily obtained. This may
cause you to degenerate your 22 into its sum, as 4, the
material, organizing and even mercenary type of mind.
The possession of a 22, as the sum of your initials or
your Public Appearance Number, will not prevent this.
Numbers only indicate the latent powers possessed, the
influences that can be used.</p>

<p><b>&mdash;<a name="anch_p128_l" id="anch_p128_l">l</a>&mdash;Warning</b>&mdash;The mere possession of a 22 in
your name or birthdate proves little, as we said of the
11. The way that you will know whether you are a
master (22) of a physical body, or whether RULED BY
your physical body (4) is the way that you will react
upon other physical bodies. You will know yourself
by the company you attract; by the way people respect
you or speak to you; by the difference between being
asked YOUR opinion and preference, or being asked
to believe theirs. What reaction your presence causes
will tell. You will know you are attaining the mastery,
when you hear this said of you, "Whatsoever He saith
unto you, DO it." (John 2:5 and 14:12.) It is a notable
fact that 11, 12, 22, when added together make
45, which is 9, a higher demonstration of the law.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
